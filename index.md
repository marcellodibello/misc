## Race and inequalities in the US

- I started with watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHkfOuTLufw) by Glenn Loury on the black family. He makes a number of interesting points, specifically:

1) In order to understand racial disparities, we need to understand disparities in social relations (e.g. family structure) not just disparities in resources, education, human capital, etc. He call these differences in "social capital".

2) Race exists becasue there are differences in social relations across groups of people. Without those differences, there would be no races. 

He does not want to "blame the victim" or deny the role of oppression and discrimination, but he also wants to highlight the role of the family. He claims that the decline of the black family (e.g. more single-parent households) implies economic decline for black people. Loury also blamed welfarist policies that encourage single-parent families.

- Obviously, I started doing research on the black family and the extent ti accounts for racial disaparities

## Causality and RCD

- [The Smartest RCT Critic]() 
 > Basically on Nancy Cartwright criticism of RCT, i.e. that they are internally valid, but not externally valid (cannot be easily generalized to populations outside those studied in the experiment). We see this with the Covid-19 vaccine. You use a RCT among certain demographic groups, in certain places at a certain time. You then find that the vaccine is effective. Then, you give the vaccine to other people, at a later time, maybe different demographic groups. Will it work? Probably, but it mght also not work. Not completely sure.

## The Breaking Down of Public Reason
 
 
- (RWL) [Naomi Zack, Progressive Anonymity: From Identity Politics to Evidence-Based Government](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538136034/Progressive-Anonymity-From-Identity-Politics-to-Evidence-Based-Government)

> Naomi Zack critiques identity politics and argues that both political and social identities should not enter democratic government. 
 She proposes evidence-based government by anonymous stakeholders, without preference for group affiliation or political charisma. 
 Central to this book is the theme that government should have an enduring goal of minimizing misery. 
 Toward that goal, the imperfections of evidence, matched by the imperfections of democracy, need to be accepted in commitments to 
 piecemeal public policies that benefit and include oppressors as well as the oppressed. 
 This strategy preserves the social compact idea that government exists for the benefit of all those governed. 
 Zackâ€™s original work will be useful to both scholars and students interested in studies of race, 
 political philosophy, social philosophy, and cultural criticism.
