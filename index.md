[Policing the Police: The Impact of "Pattern-or-Practice" Investigations on Crime](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27324/w27324.pdf)

Investigating police departments after a viral incident of police violence against african americans seems to increase crime by reducing police activity. 

"For investigations that were preceded by a viral incident of deadly force – Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Riverside and Ferguson – there is a marked increase in both homicide and total crime ...has resulted in 893 more homicides than would have been expected with no investigation and more than 33,472 additional
felony crimes, relative to synthetic control cities" (p. 4-5).

"Understanding the mechanism through which investigations increase crime is (necessarily) more
speculative. The leading hypothesis for why investigations increase crime is that they cause an
abrupt change in the quantity of policing activity. For investigations that were not preceded by
viral incidents of deadly use of force, investigations had no impact on the quantity of policing" (p. 6)

"Figure 10A displays the number of police-civilian contacts in Chicago by month. The line at 0 is
the month of the investigation. The month before the investigation there were 39,071 police-civilian
contacts recorded. In the month after the investigation there were 4,371 police-civilian interactions
recorded – an 89% decrease" (p. 27)

## Race and inequalities in the US (cont'ed)

- [Race and Cumulative Discrimination in the Prosecution of Criminal Defendants](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2153368713500317?journalCode=raja)

 > From the abstract: "Most research investigates the effect of a defendant’s race on severity of imposed legal sanction at only one of several decision points that comprise the criminal justice system. This myopic focus on what can be termed episodic discrimination is problematic .... Although initial results show that the effect of race on severity of outcome depends on the specific decision point analyzed, a synthesis of these race
estimates in a meta-analysis reveals that the odds of receiving a severe sanction is approximately 42% higher for a Black defendant even after controlling for prior record and other legal and extralegal variables. Thus, although the influence of a defendant’s race on the severity of sanction is statistically discernible at just two of the eight criminal justice decision points, a substantive cumulative racial discriminatory effect is
evident when all the individual decision points are considered in their totality"

## Race and inequalities in the US

I started with watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHkfOuTLufw) by Glenn Loury on the black family. He makes a number of interesting points, specifically:

1) In order to understand racial disparities, we need to understand disparities in social relations (e.g. family structure) not just disparities in resources, education, human capital, etc. He call these differences in "social capital".

2) Race exists becasue there are differences in social relations across groups of people. Without those differences, there would be no races. 

He does not want to "blame the victim" or deny the role of oppression and discrimination, but he also wants to highlight the role of the family. He claims that the decline of the black family (e.g. more single-parent households) implies economic decline for black people. Loury also blamed welfarist policies that encourage single-parent families.

Next, I started doing research on the black family and the extent to which it accounts for racial disparities. I came across this piece:

- [Three Facts About Family Structure and Race: Responding to The New York Times](https://ifstudies.org/blog/three-facts-about-family-structure-and-race-responding-to-the-new-york-times)

Carefully argued, a partisan piece though, but makes reference to respectable publications. So I am taking it seriously. Specifically:

- John Iceland, [Racial and Ethnic Inequality in Poverty and Affluence, 1959–2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-019-09512-7)

 > I read this article in its entirety. It is clear and easy to follow. It gives both descriptive and inferential statistics about poverty (family below 25k/year) and affluent (family above 125k/year) across racial groups. Interestingly, blacks have experienced a decline in poverty rates (60% in 1960 versus 24% in 2015). They have also experienced an increase in affluence rates (1% in 1960 versus 15% in 2015). This is encouraging! Racial differences in povery and affluence do persist though. Whites have experienced a (comparatively slower) decline in poverty rates (17% in 1960 versus 10% in 2015). They have also experienced a (comparatively slower) increase in affluence rates (6% in 1960 versus 33% in 2015).
  
 >  What about the inferential statistics? Here is one key finding: "The decomposition analysis also showed that the effect of family structure grew in importance and became the most significant factor among black-not only for poverty, but also for affluence, explaining about a third of the disparity in poverty and affluence in 2015." In fact, family structure (single parent family) accounts for about 35% of disparities in povery and affluence between whites and blacks in 2015. Education accouts for 15% and age for 16% in 2015. 
 
 >  Racial differences in poverty and affluence rates can be accounted for about 67% in 2015. What about the rest? One could say that discrimination, racism, oppression, etc. could account for the rest. So this agrees with Loury's stance -- i.e. do not discount the role of oppression and discrimination as an explanation, but also focus on the role of social relations (i.e. the black family).
 
 > By the way, the article uses a decomposition analysis. See here [A Stata implementation of the Blinder-Oaxaca
decomposition](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6442665.pdf)

-  Raj Chetty et al, [Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/race_paper.pdf)

> This is an impressive paper, and Chetty is of course an outstanding economist, very well-respected and deserving a very close reading. The *first finding* is that intergenerational mobility is the same between whites and hispanics, but different between whites and blacks. So the prediction is that the income gap will come to zero between whites and hispanics in the next few decades, while the income gap will persist between whites and blacks unless we eliminate that differences in intergenerational mobility. One policy implication of this is that "Transient programs that do not affect intergenerational mobility, such as temporary cash transfers, are insufficient to reduce disparities because income distributions will eventually revert back to their steady-states".

> So the question is, why these differences in intergenerational mobility---i.e. blacks are more likely to be poor and less likely to be rich conditional on their parents having the same income---across whites and blacks? The *second finding* is that "intergenerational gap in individual income is 10 percentiles for black men across the parental income distribution. In contrast, black women earn about 1 percentile more than white women conditional on parent income." So the difference is all on the side of black men, not black women. Keep in mind that the authors are measuring individual, not household income, to eliminate the effect of the difference between single-parent and two-parent households (since single-parent households earn less of course). 

> The *third finding* is essentially negative. Black men/black women differences are not easily explained by family structure, wealth or other plausible variables.
The authors write: "Controlling for parental marital status reduces black-white intergenerational gaps for men only slightly, from 10 percentiles to 9.3 percentiles. Controlling for differences in parental education also does not affect the black-white intergenerational gap significantly. The black-white intergenerational gap remains substantial even after controlling for differences in parental wealth"

> The *fourth finding* is about neighborhood effects. Not much difference here either. But something interesting comes up: "...the fraction of fathers present in low-income black households in the neighborhood is associated with better outcomes among black boys, but is uncorrelated with the outcomes of black girls and white boys. Black father presence at the neighborhood level strongly predicts black boys’ outcomes irrespective of whether their own father is present or
not, echoing the findings of Sampson (1987)". So black father presence in the neighborhhod is correlated with better intergenerational mobility for black boys. Just a correlation, not causation, but still something to look at more carefully. Figure XII and Figure XIV are particularily striking in this respect. 

> In conclusion, the authors write: "We conclude that neighborhoods with low poverty rates, high rates of father presence among blacks, and low levels of racial bias among whites have better outcomes for black boys and smaller racial gaps".

- [The Smartest RCT Critic]() 
 > Basically on Nancy Cartwright criticism of RCT, i.e. that they are internally valid, but not externally valid (cannot be easily generalized to populations outside those studied in the experiment). We see this with the Covid-19 vaccine. You use a RCT among certain demographic groups, in certain places at a certain time. You then find that the vaccine is effective. Then, you give the vaccine to other people, at a later time, maybe different demographic groups. Will it work? Probably, but it mght also not work. Not completely sure.

> Naomi Zack critiques identity politics and argues that both political and social identities should not enter democratic government. 
 She proposes evidence-based government by anonymous stakeholders, without preference for group affiliation or political charisma. 
 Central to this book is the theme that government should have an enduring goal of minimizing misery. 
 Toward that goal, the imperfections of evidence, matched by the imperfections of democracy, need to be accepted in commitments to 
 piecemeal public policies that benefit and include oppressors as well as the oppressed. 
 This strategy preserves the social compact idea that government exists for the benefit of all those governed. 
 Zack’s original work will be useful to both scholars and students interested in studies of race, 
 political philosophy, social philosophy, and cultural criticism.
