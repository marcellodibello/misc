## Theory of uncertainty? 

What is the right theory of uncertainty--the right inference engine that allows us to form beliefs and reach conclusions about events, facts and hypotheses that are uncertain? Clearly probability theory has to play a role. Bayesianism is the theory. But that does not seem right. The main objection I see comes from **small worlds** or **unanticipated possibilities**. You calculate probabilities given a small world--say a game of chance, with fixed sample space and clearly defined rules governing the production of outcomes? Clearly probability applies there. And it is an excellent guide.

But you might have forgotten, not considered certain possibilities. Or these possibilities might not be salient to you at the time you construct your small world model relative to which you calculate the probabilities. So how can these probabilities be action guiding? They are model relative. They say: If the world is like the model, then the chances are like this. But what if the world is *not* like the model? Then, what? Then, the probabilities can be wrong and get you astray. 

This might not seem a bit problem. Everything, after all, is model relative. If the model is wrong, then the reccomendations coming from the model are wrong. The same applies to data. I base my decisions on data, but the data can be wrong or fabricated or whatever, and if so, then I am in trouble if I follow the data! But this does not mean I should *not* follow the data. So what is the problem with probabilities then?

Well, the inferences and decisions we make are not make in small worl, but the real world---the *big* world. So a theory of uncertainity should operate in the big world, not in the small world. It would be a incomplete theory of uncertainty if it were limited to small worlds. So the problem is this: Bayesianim is a good theory of uncertainty in the small world, but what about the big world? This is the question. 

This question becomes more pressing as we look at other realms or domain besides small worlds. What about law, finance, medicine or even personal life decisions? Even in science, say physics, it does not seem that probability---Bayesianism---gives us a good account of what is going on. 

In **law**, the most penetrating critique of Bayesianism is offered by Ron Allen. I know his work, but it would be good to get his objections all in one place.

In **economics**, monetary policy and social science, this book seems good as a critique of Bayesianism:

- John Kay and Mervyn King (2020), [Radical Uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Uncertainty-Decision-Making-Beyond-Numbers/dp/1324004770)

In philosopbhy of **science**, here is a survey article:

- John Norton, [Challenges to Bayesian confirmation theory](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Challenges_final.pdf)

How do **financial planners** make decisions? What guiding principles of uncertainty do they follow? Are they just guided by probabilities and expected utility?

## Rootclaim debate about the origins of Covid-19

Rootclaim holds that covid spread because of alab leak. It bet usd 100,000 this was the right claim and anyone who wanted to challange them was free to do. Peter Miller did and [won](https://blog.rootclaim.com/rootclaims-covid-19-origins-debate-results/), defending the view that covid came from animals, possible from bats to civets sold in the Wuhnan wildlife market. I have started watching the debate. It is very interesting.

The debate is relevant for my earlier question, what is the right theory of uncertainty---the right inference engine that allows us to form beliefs and reach conclusions about events, facts and hypotheses that are uncertain? Rootclaim did probabilistic analysis. Peter Miller, instead, did what we might call a fact-focused narrative analysis. He collected as many facts as reasonably available, put them toghether in a resonable way, compared the strengths of the two competing theories (animal origin versus lab leak) and concluded that the lab leak theory had to posit many more coincidences than the animal origin theory. It seems Peter Milller thought that the animal origin theory explains the evidence/facts we have better than lab leak does. Rootclaim might not disagree with that, but still hold that the lab leak theory is more probable overall. So what is the criterion to follow? Explanatory power or likelihood of truth? 

One of the judges in the debate wrote (in a blog [entry](https://ermsta.com/posts/20240301)) that he thought probability theory is not the right framework to assess the evidence. He still provided a probabilistic analysis, but did not think it was dispositive:

> I was concerned that people might interpret my Bayesian analysis as the “main product” of the report, in isolation from the rest, which is why I heavily cautioned against taking it too literally; indeed I explicitly state that I do not think it is an appropriate technique for this problem, and am only producing one because it feels fair to do so after criticizing Rootclaim’s analysis.

Interesting! Hiw very detailed decision is below:

- Eric Stansifer, [Rootclaim covid-19 origins debate: Final decision](https://ermsta.com/r/covid_decision_20240217.pdf)

I need to read it carefully, and see why Eric thought Bayesianism is not the right (or not the ultimate?) guide for 
judging the debate about the origins of covid. But the clash between explanatory power of a story versus and likelihood of a story is reminiscient of debates in legal scholarship, between legal probabilists/Bayesians and Ronald Allen who prefers relative plausibility. 

## Trump Excutive Order on DEI (and Florida analogous HB7 bill)

ACLU wrote a memo about [Trump on DEI and anti-discrmination law](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/07/Memo_Trump_DEI_v4.pdf). It is a good read, informative and well-researched, but I was confused by the presentation, tone and overall argument.  Consider this claim:

> A second Trump administration would supercharge efforts to censor discussion of any concepts deemed
“divisive” from the nation’s classrooms, by which it means classroom discussions about race, gender, and systemic
oppression with which it disagrees. (p. 2).

What the ACLU claims here might be true as a matter of fact---that is, this might very well be what Trum has actually in mind---but we should look at the evidence and the historical record. So what comes to mind is the executive order banning DEI (actually, [Executive Order Combating Race Sex Stereotyping](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-race-sex-stereotyping/) issued in September 2020). In it (Section 2), we find a list of "divise concepts" . Here it is:

> (a) “Divisive concepts” means the concepts that (1) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (2) the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist; (3) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (4) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (5) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (6) an individual’s moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (7) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (8) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (9) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. The term “divisive concepts” also includes any other form of race or sex stereotyping or any other form of race or sex scapegoating.

If you did not know this list came from the infamous executive order, you probably would disagree with most of the items, if not all the items in the list. For who would agree that (1) one race is superior to another? Only racists would. Or who would agree that (3) people, just becaue of their race, are racist? Or who would agree that (4) people should be discriminated against because of their race? Or who would agree that (6) one's moral character is determined by their race? And so on. So many of these items will seem to most of us certainly "divisive" and quite simply morally abhorrent.

So, these divisive concepts, as listed in the exective order, are not "classroom discussions about race, gender, and systemic
oppression", as the ACLU memo suggests. They are actually, again as stated in the order, quite divisive. Now, as I said, Trump might actually want to prohibit any discusison about race, racism or structural oppression. Some of his voters might actually want that. But this is not what the exective order says. More care in framing arguments by the ACLU would be welcome. 

After the executive order came out in September 2020, the Berkeley Center of Othering and Belonging--whose mission "to build a world where everyone belongs" sounds great---[commented](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/why-trumps-diversity-training-ban-unconstitutional) as follows:

> The Executive Order grossly misrepresents the nature of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion training. As someone who has conducted or helped prepare countless such trainings, I have never made such claims or anything close to such claims. Most of my training materials include data, facts, figures, laws and policies, and recommendations for reform or policy change. In fact, saying that a person is inherently superior because of their race or sex is not only antithetical to the concept of equity, it is one of the definitions of racism. It would be absurd for an antiracist training to trade in such claims.

That is exactly right! If no DEI person would ever push any such divise concepts, the order isn't about DEi. It is about, quite simply, divisive concepts. DEI practioners have nothing to fear. Some will say this is naive---that the target is actually DEI as whole. Or is it perhpas just DEI that can be divisive in the way described in the order? But why would the order want to target DEI as a while if, as DEI practioners themselves, can attest that the order does not targer DEI?

So the question becomes. Do DEI practioners actually push diviside concepts? If they don't the order, at least on its face, cannot target them. To be sure, the order likely has a chilling effect. DEI practioners for fear of litigigatio might self-censor even though they not actually professing any divisive concepts. This is certainly risk that should not be overestimated. 

Let's now look at teh Florida H7B which has a similar intent. The key bit is this:

> 760.10 Unlawful employment practices.—
> 8)(a) Subjecting any individual, as a condition of
> employment, membership, certification, licensing, credentialing,
> or passing an examination, to training, instruction, or any
> other required activity that espouses, promotes, advances,
> inculcates, or compels such individual to believe any of the
> following concepts constitutes discrimination based on race,
> color, sex, or national origin under this section:

This paragraph is then followed by a liust of divisive concepts or claim, mostly verbatim 
from the exective order. So no need to repeating them here.

But there are a couple of interesting wrinkles. The first is this:

> (b) Paragraph (a) may not be construed to prohibit
discussion of the concepts listed therein as part of a course of
training or instruction, provided such training or instruction
is given in an objective manner without endorsement of the
concepts.

This is, at least on its face, rather reassuring. Discussions about race, discrmination, racissm, etc. are not banned.
The point is to make sure they do not push divisive concepts. In fact, later on the Bill describes a few componts of the school
curriculum and lists this:

> Instructional personnel may facilitate
> discussions and use curricula to address, in an age-appropriate
> manner, how the individual freedoms of persons have been
> infringed by slavery, racial oppression, racial segregation, and
> racial discrimination, as well as topics relating to the
> enactment and enforcement of laws resulting in racial
> oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination

This is, again, rather reasuring. The bill explitly states that instrucutor would cover topics such as racisms, discrimination and racial oppression.  This is far from, as the ACLU put it, a ban on "classroom discussions about race, gender, and systemic
oppression"
