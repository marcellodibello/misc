## Algorithmic Bias

- [](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/08/level-results-injustice-shows-why-algorithms-are-never-neutral)
   > Nothing particularly relevlatory here. The claim seems to be that algorithms may entrench disparities as they rely on biased data. But the example is quite interesting. Quotation: "Yesterday (13 August) was A-level results day in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Owing to the cancellation of A-level and GCSE exams, the English regulator Ofqual’s statistical model determined students’ grades, based on their school’s recent exam history, as well as each student’s prior exam performance. This caused outrage: because Ofqual’s model seemed crude, because some students were cheated out of the opportunity to prove their teachers wrong by exceeding expectations, and because nearly 40 per cent of A-level results were downgraded."
   
   > So they are using an algorithm to predict and assign grades to students? That's pretty cool, or awful. 
   
   > The big problem for tha author: "Statistical models often pick up on large-scale historical patterns or racial, gender and class inequalities and replicate them as data patterns, while simultaneously endowing these patterns with an air of certainty, neutrality and objectivity. After all, numbers don’t have agendas, right? This is a dangerous illusion. How we choose to use statistical models, which questions we ask (and don’t ask) when we “simply look at the numbers” depends on political assumptions and priorities. If we do not carefully consider who merits the benefit of the doubt – who typically gets given more leeway to prove their potential due to their proximity to prestige, and who is more likely to be considered an inevitable product of a bad environment – then BAME students and working-class students will be further disadvantaged by the use of statistical inference methods."
   
   > That's an interesting point. But I feel the argument is not completely worked out. How does the argument work? Is it that disadvantaged students are more likely to be judged by the algorithm worse than they actually perform compared to other students? Or is it that disadvantaged students should be assessed more carefully -- or more leniently? -- than others to give them the benefit of the douhbt and thus more opportunities down the road in life? The assumptions of the argument are not spelled out by the author. This is a journalistic piece, though.

## How to Study Racial disparities

- [How to Study Racial Disparities](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-study-racial-disparities/)
   > Interesting piece. *Claim 1*: studies that control for race are meaningless. If race is assigned at birth and influences what comes next (schooling, neighborhood, etc.), it makes no sense to ask whether disaprities in say, income, are due to race v. education. It would like asking whether different mortality rates are due to smoking v. lung cancer. Well smoking (read: race) affects lung cancer (read: education)!
   
   > Quotation: "Consider the following analogy: if researchers set out to investigate whether smoking leads to death, but controlled for whether someone gets lung cancer, they might find that smoking doesn’t increase mortality—because they’ve effectively removed an important pathway by which smoking influences health. What’s more, by controlling for lung cancer, they’re now comparing the life spans of smokers who don’t get lung cancer, who are likely to be unusually healthy, to nonsmokers without lung cancer (and comparing nonsmokers who get lung cancer, a highly unusual group, to smokers who get lung cancer)."
   
   > This analogy with police killings and Fryer work is not completely clear, though. Quotation:" Similar issues abound in the study of race and policing. Take the recent debate over whether there is evidence of racism in American policing. Roland Fryer, an economist at Harvard, found that police shoot white, Black and Hispanic Americans whom they’ve stopped at equal rates. However, as political scientists Dean Knox, Will Lowe, and Jonathan Mummolo point out, if there is initial discrimination in who gets stopped in the first place, estimating racial disparities in how people are treated once they’ve been stopped becomes much more complicated—especially since police officers are more likely to stop Black and Hispanic people than white people, and more of those stops are unjustified. If Black people are stopped by police for lesser (or nonexistent) offenses, “equal treatment” in terms of the use of force would actually indicate deeply unequal policing overall. Being stopped by the police is “post-treatment” to race, and failing to account for this bias can lead to erroneous conclusions that may mask the extent of racism in American institutions."
   
   > That is a different issue, I think. We have two different probabilities here. (a) Probability of x being shot by police if black versus (b) probability of x being shot by police if black AND stopped. Both are interesting. If (b) isn't different for whites and blacks, but (a) is, this suggests that the racial bias in police shootings does not exist after te stop but before the stop (say, in the decision about whom to stop). If so, this seems a pretty interesting piece of information. And Fryer's work helps us to see that. What's wrong with that?
   
   > But perhpas the authors have in mind something different. The claim is that whites and blacks are stopped for differenr reasons -- often there are serious reasons for stopping whites, and often there are not so serious reasons for stopping blacks. There are a lot of pretext stops of blacks. Now, if the populations of those who are stopped by the police are so different acrosso races, but we still get an equal probability of police hosting across the two populations, then this is evidence of unequael treatment, not equal treatment. Seems an interesting point. Worth thinkign about! I would expect, however, that Fryer did control for such differences in the populations of those who are stopped. This shoud be checked. 
   
   > *Claim 2*: let's think of race as a cluster of microproperties (skin tone, hair, name, accent etc.) and let's study differences in outcome due to those microproperties, leaving the general label "race" aside. This will allow for more fine-grained studies of the causes of racial disparities and we will be able to "fix the problem" more effectively. For example, see the [late Pager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devah_Pager)'s research on names and hiring preferences.  She uses names, not race directly. So her result is more accurate. Interestingly, that's also its weakness because some people could say "but a name does not really tell you about someone's race!" So we are in a dilemma here.

   > The claim here is that (a) Trump has helped low income families by cutting regulations since (b) regulations hurt lower income people the most. These are provocative claims, worth considering. But are they true? Can we empirically assess them?  The author claims he has run some estimates, but should we believe them? To be continued. The author cites this paper (which I should read):

   > The argument here is simple. State and city budgets spent billions for police, and just a few millions for housing, social services, etc. How about we spend more for social services and less for the police? Perhas, this way we can create safer and better serviced communites ... and crime will go down. The idea is simple. Does it work? Are things so simple? What is undeniable, however, is that too much public resources -- billions of dollars! -- are spent on the police. Why?
   
    > I shoud take what I wrote above back. A [closer look](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/what-police-spending-data-can-and-cannot-explain-amid-calls-defund-police) at state and city budgets shows that they do not spend that much on the police. The data must be aggregated along different lines of spending and if one does that, it seems that police spending makes on average 4-6% of city and state budget, not an a big number. So "defunding the police" is an ovestatement? Perhpas not, but it not so clear-cut as he earlier article made it seem. 
   
   - [What Disbanding the Police Really Meant in Camden, New Jersey](https://www.wired.com/story/disbanding-police-really-meant-camden/)
   
   > Looks like the defunding of the Camden police meant two things: (a) lower salaries for new police officers and (b) less traditional policing and more softpolicing (AI, surveillance, etc.). Also looks like crime rates dropped because of gentrification and many residents were pushed out of Camden. So this [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/us/disband-police-camden-new-jersey-trnd/index.html) is a bit misleading, to say the least!
 
 ## US woke scholarship, American cultural hegemony
  
 - [Beyoncé and the Heart of Darkness](https://africasacountry.com/2019/09/beyonces-heart-of-darkness)
     >  I think the point of this article, written by an African intellectual, is to say that "woke scholarship" or "woke music" (see Beyonce) is another expression of Western American cultural imperialism. Africa is looked through the lenses of American history, be the history of white people or the history of black Americans.  As the subtitle says "Few black thinkers and creatives in the United States seem able to grapple with the implications of their Americocentrism in relation to Africa."
      
     > I think this point is well taken.  But the author suggests that we should look at Africans simply as "people". I wonder, isn't this another way to essentialize Africans? Isn't "people" another concept created by European philosophers? Wouldn't that be another way of Americocentrism? After all, the author is saying that we should look at Africans as "individuals" -- another key idea in American society. Perhaps -- and more charitably --  the author is saying that we should look at Africans for who they are, however they are, whatever they are. That's hard. And is it even possible? Does it even make sense? We always look at people through our lenses. Perhpas we should be aware of these lenses as much we can and try to remove them--and Americans writers and creatives do not do that. Yes, perhpas that's what the author meant!

  > Interesting US Sup Ct case, especially Thomas' concurring opinion. His point is that abortion in that 1920ies had eugenics motives. As it turns out, even today black children are aborted at disproportionately higher rates than white children. So abortion is still fullfilling its eugenics motives (keeping in mind that in the 1920ies eugenists thought that black people were inferior and thus their natality rate had to be limited, hence the need for abortion as eugenic tool). 
  
  > Thomas makes another point. Just as it was wong for eugenists to infer the inferiority of black people from disparate rates of achievement (disparate rates of achievement can after all be due to all sorts of factors, not racial inferiority), similarly it is wrong for us today to infer racism from racially disparate rates of achievemtns. The two forms of reasoning follow the same logic, says Thomas. It is not exactly clear how, but it is an interetsing point nonetheless. Thomas cites Sowell, footnote 4. Denial of the complexity of the human experience is the culprit here. ("Both eugenics and disparate-impact liability rely on the simplistic and often faulty assumption that "some one particular factor is the key or dominant factor behind differences in outcomes" and that one should expect "an even or random distribution of outcomes ... in the absence of such complicating causes as genes or discrimination." Sowell 25, 87. Among other pitfalls, these assumptions tend to collapse the distinction between correlation and causation and shift the analytical focus away from "flesh-and-blood human being[s]" to impersonal statistical groups frozen in time. Id., at 83; see id., at 87-149 (explaining how statistics and linguistics can be used to obscure realities). Just as we should not assume, based on bare statistical disparities, "that the Negro lacks in his germ-plasm excellence of some qualities which the white races possess," Applied Eugenics 285, "[w]e should not automatically presume that any institution with a neutral practice that happens to produce a racial disparity is guilty of discrimination until proved innocent."

  > Challenge: is behaviour heritable? 
  
  > Goal is to maximize passing down one's gene, via (building block 1) individual selection (maximization of reproduction), or (building block 2) kin selection (since we share genes with twin brothers, 100%, broters, 1/2, and cousins, 1/8 of genes) by allowing one's of our kin to reproduce instead of us, or via (building block 3) cooperation.
  
   > Reciprocal altruism and cooperation. Rock/paper/seazar scenarios. Requires animal who are able to recognize one another over time. But this also hapens with bacteria. There could be cheating during this reciprocal cooperation.  
   
   > When do you cooperate and when do you cheat? Game theory. Prisoner's dilemma. Tit for tat strategy is the most optimal (start cooperating, coooperate next if the other cooperated, but cheat if they did not cooperate, and then go back to cooperate if they cooperated before). This strategy drives all the other strategies into extinction.  But this strategy is vulnerable to signal error. Robert Axelrod. 
   
   > Better strategy. Forgiving tit for tat. If cheating comes up too for long, forgive in one round (leaving open possibility of signal error, the other cooperated but you mstook for cheating). This prevails over strict tit for tat. 
   
   > But forgiving Tit for Tar is vulnerable to exploitation if the other doe snot forgive. 
   
   > Even better strategy: start with strict tit for tat, and after a while without being cheated, then switch to forgiving tit for tat (you trust the other).
   
   > But Pavlov Tit for Tat could exploit the earlier Tit for Tat. 
   
   > "The Optimal Benefit of Perceived Madness" by Ellsberg.
   
   > Biologists looked at this formal work. Do animals behave in the way described by game theory?
   
   > Example 1: Vampire. System of altruism.  Bats feed everybody's babies with blood they found. Others reciprocate next time. Blood vampire commune.  Tit for Tat. But if there is seeming cheating if one bat (signal error), altruistic behavior is interrupted. 
   
   > Example 2: Fish. Tit for tat strategy. 
   
   > Example 3: Fish species that would change sex. 
   
   > So optimal behaviour (tit for that strategy) is selected by natural selection logic 
   
   > Exceptions: Naked mole rat. Big cooperative colonies. Lots of work. Reciprocities all over. There were one or two animals in the colony that were not doing any work. But no punishment for them. Why? There is another game going on. Those who did no work usually had the job of protecting colonies against floods and water. Work diversification. Multiple games going on.

The main outcomes we examine are: individual income rank in 2014–2015 for black boys, when they were aged 31–37 years; the expected fraction of black boys incarcerated on April 1, 2010; and the expected fraction of black girls who had children as teenagers. Each of these outcomes is of fundamental interest to researchers in the social sciences."

> *explanatory variables*: "Our explanatory variables are constructed from the Census; the Community Survey of the PHDCN, which interviewed a representative sample of Chicago residents about their neighborhood social environments in 1995 and 2002 (combined N of ∼12,000); violent crime rates per 100,000 population from 1995 to 2000, derived from offenses reported by citizens to the police; incarceration rates per population from 1995 to 2000, derived from prison admission data; and lead exposure among children from 1995 to 1997, derived from more than 150,000 blood-level tests conducted by Chicago’s health department."

Although the magnitude of association and the explanatory power of toxicity is similar for blacks and whites, exposure levels, in Chicago at least, are markedly different: the most-exposed white tracts in our sample had levels comparable to the least-exposed black tracts, potentially accounting for racial disparities in social mobility."

  > ABSTRACT: More than 50 years after the Civil Rights Act, black–white family income disparities in the
United States remain almost exactly the same as what they were in 1968. This article argues that a
key and underappreciated driver of the racial income gap has been the national trend of rising income
inequality. From 1968 to 2016, black–white disparities in family income rank narrowed by almost
one-third. But this relative gain was negated by changes to the national income distribution that
resulted in rapid income growth for the richest—and most disproportionately white—few percentiles
of the country combined with income stagnation for the poor and middle class. But for the rise in
income inequality, the median black–white family income gap would have decreased by about 30
percent. Conversely, without the partial closing of the rank gap, growing inequality alone would
have increased the racial income gap by 30 percent

- [Racial Inequality Trends and the Intergenerational Persistence of Income and Family Structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4598060/)

  >  Interesting article. It uses computer simulations as methodology. It compares actual data about racial wealth disparities in 2008 with simulated data based on different parameters and hypotheses. 
  
  > Two main hypotheses about the persistance of racial wealth/income inequalities from 1968 to 2008. One hypothesis: intergenerational wealth transmission. Rich familites tend to trasmit their wealth down the line. Hypothesis two: changes in family structure and labor market, in particular, more single families and decline of unskilled workfprce and rise of highly technical workforce.  The paper basically argues for hypothesis two. 
  
  > Looks like that, if we hold fixed family structure (say, single family or two parent family), racial disaprities in family are not as stark today. Reduction of racial wealth disparities within the same family structure is more marked than if we lookd at disaprities in the aggregate. (Is this another version of Simpson's paradox, i.e. no discriminatory pattern in subgroups, but an overall discriminatory pattern in the aggregate?) 
  
  > So the proposed explanation, roughly, is this: (a) income disparities were equalizing from 1968 to today, but family structure was not. Black women were becoming more independent and more black single families appeared compared to white single families (though the pattern seems to affect both racial groups). (b)  Single faimilies tend to be poorer. So, by putting toghether (a) and (b), here you have the explanation. 
  
  > Also interesting is that the author looks at the entire wealth/income distribution, not just the median or mean as comonly done.

  Interesting Gorsuch's argument that Title VII CRA 1968 prohibits discrimination by sexual orientation b/c it prohibits discrimination by race
    
   >  it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer's mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague….

Disappointing exchange. Glenn and Tricia seem unable to have a reasoned conversation. Other speakers tried to create more common grounds. Glenn's main criticism of Tricia's structural racism SR approach is centered on the idea that SR is not a sophisticated enough theory to explain.  Another point he made is that--politically and moving foward--SR has little to offer. It is easy to get into polarities, such as individual responsibility vs. community responsability. Tricia adn Glenn suggest we overcome polarities.

     > We assessed racial disparities in policing in the United States by compiling and analysing a dataset detailing nearly 100 million traffic stops conducted across the country. We found that black drivers were less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a ‘veil of darkness’ masks one’s race, suggesting bias in stop decisions. Furthermore, by examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for searching white drivers. Finally, we found that legalization of recreational marijuana reduced the number of searches of white, black and Hispanic drivers—but the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was still lower than that for white drivers post-legalization. Our results indicate that police stops and search decisions suffer from persistent racial bias and point to the value of policy interventions to mitigate these disparities.

       > Interesting Amazon's review (probabilistic models versus narratives, law): "The critique of SEU theory is fair. Their development of an alternative approach to making decisions the face of uncertainty about the future is less well-specified. A lot of material is included on the way people reason by narratives, the use of small groups to exchange opinions, and the use of Taleb's positioning approach of clipping downside risks and being open to upside risks. There is some mention of scenario thinking and trying to make robust and resilient decisions in the face of uncertainty but this discussion is not well-developed as a practical proposition. I think the authors need to find out more about scenario methods beyond those of Schoemaker. There is a lot of recent stuff about combining decision analysis ( SMART) with scenarios and a lot about developing causality in scenario storylines, etc. The new Wiley journal "Futures & Foresight Science" is a good way into this developing area."

   > When faced with angry, predominantly white crowds, police agencies have proven that they are capable of discipline and a reasonable reaction to a perceived threat. It’s not crazy to wonder, had the police shown up to the anti–police brutality protests with the same level of restraint, might the escalation have been avoided? Riots are an inevitable consequence of systematic instability, or, as Martin Luther King Jr. called them, “the language of the unheard.” It’s not hard to see how meeting protesters who have come to stand against excessive use of force with an excessive use of force would lead to nowhere good.

     > Why are high- and middle-income white families so much wealthier than Black families with the same incomes? We note a few reasons. White families receive much larger inheritances on average than Black families. Economists Darrick Hamilton and Sandy Darity conclude that inheritances and other intergenerational transfers “account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other demographic and socioeconomic indicators.”
        
    > The solutions to the Black-white wealth gap—and the policies that address racial inequity more generally—are largely outside the scope of this post. But the analysis above points to at least one type of reform: taxation of income from wealth. The income from inheritances, and from wealth more generally, is taxed at an inequitably low rate, especially when compared to earnings.
        
        

- [A Prosecutor's Use of Inconsistent Factual Theories of a Crime](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3607&context=flr)

    > Prosecutors face a dilemma when two people engage in criminal
activity, but only one of the perpetrators commits the most serious
offense. In some cases, the evidence clearly establishes that the most
serious offense, oftentimes murder, was committed by only one
person. The evidence frequently does not, however, confirm which of
the suspects committed this offense. Moreover, circumstantial
evidence often suggests that either suspect could have committed the
offense. Thus, knowing that one of the two suspects committed the
offense, prosecutors face a difficult choice: they can choose not to
charge either suspect, charge only one of the suspects, or charge both
suspects with the same criminal act.

  > Real Estate. For centuries, members of R1 systematically targeted the
economic resources of members of R2 for (unjust) suppression, first
through a state-supported system of slavery, then through a statesupported system of segregation. Eventually, there was a racial rapprochement, where all state-supported means of R2’s economic repression (including criminal laws, voting rights, and tax-and-transfer schemes) were abolished. However, the rapprochement was not complete in the sense that no reparations were made to members of R2, and therefore the postrapprochement era begins with R1s uniformly
having more wealth than R2s. Two hundred years later, there are no
longer any attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs, among either R1s or R2s,
which we would ordinarily identify as racist. However, there also is
no change in mortgage policies, which ensures that more, and more
beneficial, mortgages go to those with better credit ratings, and better
credit ratings are assigned to those with greater assets. As a direct
result of this state of affairs, R2s still have fewer good homes, less
wealth, and a weaker sense of economic security than R1s have. (p. 72-73)

  >  The institutional forces at work in Real Estate can apparently be
legitimately described as racist: because the two races do not start, even
after the rapprochement, at just relative starting points, and because
the relevant credit institutions perpetuate existing inequality, those institutions perpetuate (indeed, exacerbate) a socioeconomic structure in
which members of R1 systematically and unjustly have greater access to
housing, to a comparatively accessible vehicle for growing personal
wealth, and not least to a source of perceived security and well-being
than do members of R2. Thus, while, by hypothesis, the mortgage industry has policies that are, other things being equal, just, other things
are not equal, because of the society’s racist past. Further, imagine that
everyone is well aware of the problem and wants to fix it, and at the
moment they are just waiting to vote in a referendum that will select
policies aimed at solving the problem, perhaps to determine the exact
monetary amount that should be paid to each R2 in order for their
society to have a racially just economic distribution. So, despite the fact
that no one agent is racist at this moment, a troubled past means that
their otherwise just institutions perpetuate an unjust racial inequity. This
seems to qualify those institutions as racist. (p. 73)

- [Structural Racism, Institutional Agency, and Disrespect](https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&context=rel_fac)

  > The Toxic Doughnut Hole: On the outskirts of a major U.S. city, a predominately black
community is literally surrounded by landfills, sewage plants, chemical refineries, and
toxic dumps. The air, water, and soil are polluted at levels three to four times what is
considered safe. Rates of cancer, asthma, and emphysema, among other illnesses, are
more than double that of the general population. Furthermore, the industries surrounding
this community are inspected and cited less frequently by regulatory bodies than
comparable industries in white communities, and when they are cited for regulatory
infractions, the fines levied are consistently less than those imposed for comparable
violations in white communities. Let us suppose that the directors of these industries lack
any beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors that we would normally consider racist. The
motivation for locating their facilities here is purely economic: lower real estate prices,
lower taxes, favorable zoning regulations, and etc. Let us suppose further that in locating
their facilities here, these industries actually sought out the input and consent of the
neighboring community, thus extending them due respect. And let us suppose that, as an
economically depressed community desperate for jobs and tax revenue, the community
consented to the construction and location of the facilities. (p. 9)

  > Why are zoning regulations so lax? Perhaps because
impoverished communities are also frequently politically disenfranchised, and so
raise fewer effective complaints than better-situated communities. When one
begins to ask these questions, what emerges is a picture of some populations
systematically disadvantaged by various interrelated barriers, and other
populations systematically advantaged by those same barriers. That toxic waste,
landfills, and etc. are disproportionately located in poor, minority communities
means that they are disproportionately absent from well-off white communities,
who also probably benefit more from the products and processes that produce
such waste ... Put simply, when dealing with finite
resources, a disadvantage for one group creates an advantage for everyone else.
This principle is straightforward, but frequently those who are willing to admit
that racial minorities face significant disadvantages resist making the logical step
of acknowledging that non-minorities thus enjoy significant advantages. That
these advantages and disadvantages track along racial lines means that they are
not based on merit, just transfer, or any other plausible criteria for distributive
justice. In short, they are undeserved. This is why they represent an injustice. (p. 11)

    > How do we act morally at a time of immense collective uncertainty, without pretending that we know how to transform this uncertainty into calculable odds? Trolley-like trade-off arguments prevent us from facing these questions. When they warn about “deaths of despair,” for example, they sneak in ipso facto precisely what needs to be changed about the American status quo; indeed, what the pandemic could serve as a lever for changing — namely the casualization and systemic precarity of the labor force (Griesbach, 2020), the dismantling of social services and community support, the declining trust in institutions. These are the “rails” on which their trade-off argument proceeds. 
 
   > In the Judeo-Christian tradition there is a counter-fable. This is the famous Rabbinical story, of which the Church Fathers were fond as well, about Moses and the lamb. While herding a flock of sheep through the desert, so the story goes, Moses noticed that a single little lamb was lost. Risking the safety of the whole herd, he sets out on his own to find and save the single lamb. Seeing this, God selects him to be the leader of his people because, God says, he has the quality of mercy.

  > Unable or unwilling to accommodate our nation’s need to deliver superior higher education to millions of new students, most major research universities, both public and private, appear content to maintain the status quo and seek prestige through ever-increasing exclusivity. But success in maintaining excellence in a small number of elite institutions does little to advance our society or ensure continued national competitiveness. The issue of broad accessibility to research-grade academic platforms is far more urgent than policymakers realize, even those on the national stage charged with advancing higher education policy. Our national discussion on higher education must not simply focus on the production of more college graduates. Mere access for greater numbers to rudimentary forms of instruction will not deliver desired societal outcomes ... The imperative is to ensure that far more students —an order of magnitude more—have access to research-grade academic platforms that deliver advanced skills commensurate with the demands of the knowledge economy.
