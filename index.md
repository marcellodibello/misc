Going back to the landmark Sup. Ct decision on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and being transgender (SOT for short). [Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/17-1618). While these expressions are not explicitly present in Title VII, the Court held that discrminating on the basis of SOT is ultimately discrmination on the basis of sex, and thus prohibited by Title VII. Here is one key passage:

> it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer intentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee’s sex, and the affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge.

The way I understand this is by running the appropriate counterfactual test for but-for causation. The two employees are indistinguishable---they both like men, equally qualified, etc.---but one is male (and thus homosexual) and the other female (thus heterosexual). If the male emplyoee is fired because of their sexual preference towards men, then had they been female they would not have been fired (since their sexual preference towards men would not be problematic). So, being fired becaue of sexual preference towards men (discrimination based on sexual preference) implies being fired because of being man (discriminatiom based on sex).

> Or take an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. Again, the individual employee’s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.

In the transgender case the reasoning seems similar. The two employees are identical except that one identifies as female at birth while the other transitioned from male to female. If the employer fires the latter, but would not have fired the former, this means that had the emplyoee being female (at birth), they would not have been fired. So, again discrimination based on transgenderism is also discrimination based on sex. 

I wonder what Lily Hu's examples have to say about that? Here is one case from here dissertation:

> AUDIT STUDY I: Skirt Interview - Two actors, one taken to be male and the other female, present identical resumes, answer interviewer questions identically, and affect the same tone, mannerisms, and general personality traits (as best as they can). The male actor also dons the same dress and wears the same facial makeup as the female actor; both actors wear skirts and facial makeup to their interviews. (p. 86)

Suppose one actor is hired but the othert is not. Or suppose you can track the disparity across many alike cases. So what is the cause of the decision?  It is sex/gender or something else? Hu seems to think, if I remember right, that it's not clear here whether the discrmination was because of sex/gender or because of failure to follow gender conforming rules. In fact, it's  likely that the discrimination was becaue of the gender rules, not sex/gender.  But a manipulationist account of causation -- keep everythign the same, just change sex/gender -- would say that the cause here is sex/geder, not conformity or not with gender roles. 

But, interestingly, the US Sup. Ct. does not find anything problematic here. And in fact, during the oral argument, they talk about cases involving women behaving according to male gender norm or men behaving according to female gender norms. Some of the Justices seem to think that, if these individuals were discriminated because of their gender non-conformity, they would be discriminated---at least in part---because of their sex/gender. Here is the lawyer Pamela S. Karlan representing Bostock:

> I'm simply saying that if a man and a woman both wanted to sew and you fire the man who loves sewing and you don't fire the woman who loves sewing, that's discrimination pure and simple, sex discrimination.

So, there seems to be no issue that, if someone fails to confirm with gendere norms and tyhey are disriminated becaue of that, they are also discrminated becaue of sex/gender. Justice Alito, however, disagrees:

> The -- the point is that discrimination on the basis of sex in the sense that Congress understood it in 1964 is a different concept from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

# Personalized law v precision medicine

We have personalized law, a new trend, though not so new perhaps. Legal rules tailored to individual, based on their needs, risk tolerance, metal capacities, etc. What are the ethical and legal implications of that? Does it make sense at all?

And then we have precision (personalized?) medicine.

# Nations and International Law

Interesting article about why nations do/should obey international law. Seems opuzzling. If law is binding by some state authority, then no state authority issues internatinal law. Might be a good addition or topic for the next version of my philosophy of law class.
