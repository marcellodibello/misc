     > ability to cooperate with the ICC in cases that are contrary to the national interest.

     > crimes against humanity.” .... if five requirements are met:

     > 3. These international efforts must be aimed at “bring[ing] to justice” certain individuals,
     > 4. The target of the international efforts must a “foreign national[],” and
     > 5. The foreign national must be accused of “genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity.”

- June 26, 1997: [Letter](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997-06/arms-control-today/opposition-nato-expansion) against NATO expansion, signed by 50 between foreign policy experts, former senators, retired military officers, diplomats and academics.
     
     > In Russia, NATO expansion, which continues to be opposed across the entire political spectrum, will strengthen the nondemocratic opposition, undercut those who favor reform and cooperation with the West, bring the Russians to question the entire post-Cold War settlement, and galvanize resistance in the Duma to the START II and III treaties; In Europe, NATO expansion will draw a new line of division between the "ins" and the "outs," foster instability, and ultimately diminish the sense of security of those countries which are not included
 
- May 27, 1997: [NATO Russia Founding Act](https://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/official_texts_25468.htm)

They share the goal of overcoming the vestiges of earlier confrontation and competition and of strengthening **mutual trust and cooperation**. The present Act reaffirms the determination of NATO and Russia to give concrete substance to their shared commitment to build a stable, peaceful and undivided Europe, whole and free, to the benefit of all its peoples.

     > NATO and Russia will base their relations on a shared commitment to the following principles: 
     
     > refraining from the threat or use of force against each other as well as against any other state, its sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence in any manner inconsistent with the United Nations Charter and with the Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations Between Participating States contained in the Helsinki Final Act;

The document was not meant for the public. It asserted that the US should remain the only world power and prevent any other country from becoming even a regional power. A redacted and  softened version was later published in April 1992. Some excerpts from teh February version:

    > B. defense Strategy Objectives (p. 2): The U.S. must show the leadership necessary to establish and protect 
    > a new order that holds the promise of convincing potential competitors that
    > they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests. In non-defense areas, we must 
    > account sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn 
    > the established political and economic order. We must maintain the mechanism for **deterring potential competitors 
    > from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role**.

    > We continue to recognize that collectively the conventional forces of the states formerly comprising the Soviet Union 
    > retain the most military potential in all of Eurasia; and we do not dismiss the risks to stability in Europe from a 
    > nationalist backlash in Russia or efforts to reincorporate into Russia the newly independent republics of Ukraine, Belarus, 
    > and possibly others... We must, however, be mindful that democratic change in Russia is not irreversible, and that despite 
    > its current travails, Russia will remain the strongest military power in Eurasia and the only power in the world with the 
    > capability of destroying the United States.

    > Baker: I want to ask you a question. ....Supposing unification takes place, what would you prefer: a united Germany outside of NATO, absolutely independent and without American troops; or a united Germany keeping its connections with NATO, but with the guarantee that NATO’s jurisdiction or troops will not spread east of the present boundary?
     
     >  Gorbachev: We will think everything over. We intend to discuss all these questions in depth at the leadership level. It goes without saying that a broadening of the NATO zone is not acceptable. 
     
     >  Baker: We agree with that.
