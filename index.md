  Interesting Gorsuch's argument that Title VII CRA 1968 prohibits discrimination by sexual orientation b/c it prohibits discrimination by race
    
   >  it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer's mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague….

Disappointing exchange. Glenn and Tricia seem unable to have a reasoned conversation. Other speakers tried to create more common grounds. Glenn's main criticism of Tricia's structural racism SR approach is centered on the idea that SR is not a sophisticated enough theory to explain.  Another point he made is that--politically and moving foward--SR has little to offer. It is easy to get into polarities, such as individual responsibility vs. community responsability. Tricia adn Glenn suggest we overcome polarities.

     > We assessed racial disparities in policing in the United States by compiling and analysing a dataset detailing nearly 100 million traffic stops conducted across the country. We found that black drivers were less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a ‘veil of darkness’ masks one’s race, suggesting bias in stop decisions. Furthermore, by examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for searching white drivers. Finally, we found that legalization of recreational marijuana reduced the number of searches of white, black and Hispanic drivers—but the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was still lower than that for white drivers post-legalization. Our results indicate that police stops and search decisions suffer from persistent racial bias and point to the value of policy interventions to mitigate these disparities.

       > Interesting Amazon's review (probabilistic models versus narratives, law): "The critique of SEU theory is fair. Their development of an alternative approach to making decisions the face of uncertainty about the future is less well-specified. A lot of material is included on the way people reason by narratives, the use of small groups to exchange opinions, and the use of Taleb's positioning approach of clipping downside risks and being open to upside risks. There is some mention of scenario thinking and trying to make robust and resilient decisions in the face of uncertainty but this discussion is not well-developed as a practical proposition. I think the authors need to find out more about scenario methods beyond those of Schoemaker. There is a lot of recent stuff about combining decision analysis ( SMART) with scenarios and a lot about developing causality in scenario storylines, etc. The new Wiley journal "Futures & Foresight Science" is a good way into this developing area."

   > When faced with angry, predominantly white crowds, police agencies have proven that they are capable of discipline and a reasonable reaction to a perceived threat. It’s not crazy to wonder, had the police shown up to the anti–police brutality protests with the same level of restraint, might the escalation have been avoided? Riots are an inevitable consequence of systematic instability, or, as Martin Luther King Jr. called them, “the language of the unheard.” It’s not hard to see how meeting protesters who have come to stand against excessive use of force with an excessive use of force would lead to nowhere good.

     > Why are high- and middle-income white families so much wealthier than Black families with the same incomes? We note a few reasons. White families receive much larger inheritances on average than Black families. Economists Darrick Hamilton and Sandy Darity conclude that inheritances and other intergenerational transfers “account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other demographic and socioeconomic indicators.”
        
    > The solutions to the Black-white wealth gap—and the policies that address racial inequity more generally—are largely outside the scope of this post. But the analysis above points to at least one type of reform: taxation of income from wealth. The income from inheritances, and from wealth more generally, is taxed at an inequitably low rate, especially when compared to earnings.
        
        

- [A Prosecutor's Use of Inconsistent Factual Theories of a Crime](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3607&context=flr)

    > Prosecutors face a dilemma when two people engage in criminal
activity, but only one of the perpetrators commits the most serious
offense. In some cases, the evidence clearly establishes that the most
serious offense, oftentimes murder, was committed by only one
person. The evidence frequently does not, however, confirm which of
the suspects committed this offense. Moreover, circumstantial
evidence often suggests that either suspect could have committed the
offense. Thus, knowing that one of the two suspects committed the
offense, prosecutors face a difficult choice: they can choose not to
charge either suspect, charge only one of the suspects, or charge both
suspects with the same criminal act.

  > Real Estate. For centuries, members of R1 systematically targeted the
economic resources of members of R2 for (unjust) suppression, first
through a state-supported system of slavery, then through a statesupported system of segregation. Eventually, there was a racial rapprochement, where all state-supported means of R2’s economic repression (including criminal laws, voting rights, and tax-and-transfer schemes) were abolished. However, the rapprochement was not complete in the sense that no reparations were made to members of R2, and therefore the postrapprochement era begins with R1s uniformly
having more wealth than R2s. Two hundred years later, there are no
longer any attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs, among either R1s or R2s,
which we would ordinarily identify as racist. However, there also is
no change in mortgage policies, which ensures that more, and more
beneficial, mortgages go to those with better credit ratings, and better
credit ratings are assigned to those with greater assets. As a direct
result of this state of affairs, R2s still have fewer good homes, less
wealth, and a weaker sense of economic security than R1s have. (p. 72-73)

  >  The institutional forces at work in Real Estate can apparently be
legitimately described as racist: because the two races do not start, even
after the rapprochement, at just relative starting points, and because
the relevant credit institutions perpetuate existing inequality, those institutions perpetuate (indeed, exacerbate) a socioeconomic structure in
which members of R1 systematically and unjustly have greater access to
housing, to a comparatively accessible vehicle for growing personal
wealth, and not least to a source of perceived security and well-being
than do members of R2. Thus, while, by hypothesis, the mortgage industry has policies that are, other things being equal, just, other things
are not equal, because of the society’s racist past. Further, imagine that
everyone is well aware of the problem and wants to fix it, and at the
moment they are just waiting to vote in a referendum that will select
policies aimed at solving the problem, perhaps to determine the exact
monetary amount that should be paid to each R2 in order for their
society to have a racially just economic distribution. So, despite the fact
that no one agent is racist at this moment, a troubled past means that
their otherwise just institutions perpetuate an unjust racial inequity. This
seems to qualify those institutions as racist. (p. 73)

- [Structural Racism, Institutional Agency, and Disrespect](https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&context=rel_fac)

  > The Toxic Doughnut Hole: On the outskirts of a major U.S. city, a predominately black
community is literally surrounded by landfills, sewage plants, chemical refineries, and
toxic dumps. The air, water, and soil are polluted at levels three to four times what is
considered safe. Rates of cancer, asthma, and emphysema, among other illnesses, are
more than double that of the general population. Furthermore, the industries surrounding
this community are inspected and cited less frequently by regulatory bodies than
comparable industries in white communities, and when they are cited for regulatory
infractions, the fines levied are consistently less than those imposed for comparable
violations in white communities. Let us suppose that the directors of these industries lack
any beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors that we would normally consider racist. The
motivation for locating their facilities here is purely economic: lower real estate prices,
lower taxes, favorable zoning regulations, and etc. Let us suppose further that in locating
their facilities here, these industries actually sought out the input and consent of the
neighboring community, thus extending them due respect. And let us suppose that, as an
economically depressed community desperate for jobs and tax revenue, the community
consented to the construction and location of the facilities. (p. 9)

  > Why are zoning regulations so lax? Perhaps because
impoverished communities are also frequently politically disenfranchised, and so
raise fewer effective complaints than better-situated communities. When one
begins to ask these questions, what emerges is a picture of some populations
systematically disadvantaged by various interrelated barriers, and other
populations systematically advantaged by those same barriers. That toxic waste,
landfills, and etc. are disproportionately located in poor, minority communities
means that they are disproportionately absent from well-off white communities,
who also probably benefit more from the products and processes that produce
such waste ... Put simply, when dealing with finite
resources, a disadvantage for one group creates an advantage for everyone else.
This principle is straightforward, but frequently those who are willing to admit
that racial minorities face significant disadvantages resist making the logical step
of acknowledging that non-minorities thus enjoy significant advantages. That
these advantages and disadvantages track along racial lines means that they are
not based on merit, just transfer, or any other plausible criteria for distributive
justice. In short, they are undeserved. This is why they represent an injustice. (p. 11)

    > How do we act morally at a time of immense collective uncertainty, without pretending that we know how to transform this uncertainty into calculable odds? Trolley-like trade-off arguments prevent us from facing these questions. When they warn about “deaths of despair,” for example, they sneak in ipso facto precisely what needs to be changed about the American status quo; indeed, what the pandemic could serve as a lever for changing — namely the casualization and systemic precarity of the labor force (Griesbach, 2020), the dismantling of social services and community support, the declining trust in institutions. These are the “rails” on which their trade-off argument proceeds. 
 
   > In the Judeo-Christian tradition there is a counter-fable. This is the famous Rabbinical story, of which the Church Fathers were fond as well, about Moses and the lamb. While herding a flock of sheep through the desert, so the story goes, Moses noticed that a single little lamb was lost. Risking the safety of the whole herd, he sets out on his own to find and save the single lamb. Seeing this, God selects him to be the leader of his people because, God says, he has the quality of mercy.

  > Unable or unwilling to accommodate our nation’s need to deliver superior higher education to millions of new students, most major research universities, both public and private, appear content to maintain the status quo and seek prestige through ever-increasing exclusivity. But success in maintaining excellence in a small number of elite institutions does little to advance our society or ensure continued national competitiveness. The issue of broad accessibility to research-grade academic platforms is far more urgent than policymakers realize, even those on the national stage charged with advancing higher education policy. Our national discussion on higher education must not simply focus on the production of more college graduates. Mere access for greater numbers to rudimentary forms of instruction will not deliver desired societal outcomes ... The imperative is to ensure that far more students —an order of magnitude more—have access to research-grade academic platforms that deliver advanced skills commensurate with the demands of the knowledge economy.
