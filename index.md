## Breonna Taylor

- [Why It’s Not So Simple To Arrest The Cops Who Shot Breonna Taylor]()

> Interesting piece, legally speaking. The **castle doctrine** says that one is allowed to shoot if someone is entering one's house. No obligation to retreat. But this right to shoot does not apply when the police is entering one's home as long as the officers announce themselves or the homeowner reasonably should have known they were police. The problem is that the officers were executing a **no-knock warrant**. So Walker could not have known they were police so he is entitled to shoot agains them. On their hand, the officers had a right to enter and not be fired against. They can invoke **self-defense**. There seems to be a tension between no-knowck warrant and the castle doctrine.

## Woke Epistemology?

> Looks like woke epistemology is an attack agaist our faith in evidence, data and reasoning. Why? Because even evidence, data and reasonig are biased and thus a locus of poer struggle, racism, sexism, oppression. They are not immune to the general logic of oppression, sexism and racism. I think the philosoiphcal foundation of all this is femist epistemology. Read the [SEP entry](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/) on the topic. To be done! 

> This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xILBpDOqD-A) by wokal_distance is also instructive, though -- as I explain below -- a bit too simplistic I think. 

## Is Woke Mathematics Really that Bad?

> twitter contributor wokal_distance has engeged in an interesting project, i.e. breaking down "woke thought", its assumptions and philosophical grounding in simple language. This is a good service. Yet when it comes to woke mathematics, he seems to offer a charicature rather than a balanced portrayal (see thread [here](https://twitter.com/wokal_distance/status/1278886205665361921)). 

> Here is why. Consider the book [Mathematics for Social Justice: Resources for the College Classroom](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/mathematics-for-social-justice-resources-for-the-college-classroom). This is an example of woke mathematics according to wokal_distance. I read a few chapters of the book. This reads more like a collection of teaching tools to show the applications of mathematics, say, to voting, income distribution, interest rates, mortages, etc. This seems a valuable way to make mathematics  acessible -- not by watering down its content, but by showing that virtually everythig follows a pattern that can be explained using mathematical concepts. I do not think any of this is new -- economists have always applied math to the world -- but nonethless useful and interesting. Maybe woke mathematical teaching is just a way of rebranding math? 

> This quotation from the book gives a vivid example of what I am talking about: 

> The Credit Card Problem asks, given a fixed initial balance 𝑃 on a credit card,
a fixed interest rate 𝑟 compounded monthly, and a fixed monthly payment 𝑀, how long does it take to pay off a credit card? The solution is given by the equation: 
𝑛 = ln ( 𝑀 / 𝑀−𝑟𝑃) / ln (1 +  𝑟).
Such a problem fits very naturally into a unit on logarithms. In the process of working through the problem, a need for logarithms naturally arises!
The solution to the credit card problem raises an interesting mathematical question related to the domain of the logarithm. The denominator has no problems since
1 + r > 0 as 𝑟 > 0. However, the numerator may not always be defined. Namely, in order
for the logarithm to be defined, we need to have 𝑀 > 𝑟𝑃. This makes intuitive sense, it
tells us that in order to be able to pay the credit card balance off in finite time, we need
our monthly payment to be larger than the dollar amount of interest accumulated on
the principal each month.
The ethical question here has to do with a decision regarding minimum payments.
Specifically, is it ethically appropriate to offer a credit card holder the option to pay a
minimum monthly payment that is less than 𝑟𝑃? Many consumers who find themselves in credit card debt and are struggling to make ends meet will only make the
minimum monthly payment in order to stay current and stay afloat. Mathematically,
when 𝑀 < 𝑟𝑃, the solution to the credit card problem flies to infinity. 

> I found this example neat. It introduces a difficult math notion, logarithm. It makes people think about real world issues. It is a nice blend of mathematics and ethics.  And it should have the added advantage of drawing more students into the intricaces of mathematical modeling. If this is woke mathematics, it isn't really that bad. But perhaps there are deeper transformations going on which are not fully reflected in the book in question. That might very well be true. And these deeper transformations might be more dramatic.

## Police violence and conflicting evidence

- [Police Violence and the Rush to Judgment](https://quillette.com/2020/09/08/police-violence-and-the-rush-to-judgment/)

> The article points out, with great detail and many examples, something  obvuous. We are quick to judge that an episode of police violece is racially motivated even when the evidence isn't perfectly clear. Interetsingly, even in the Floyd cae the evidence seems mixed. Still, that police are racist is often a tacit, unquestioned assumption.  This seems true. But is it false to say that the police are racist?

> I once heard Zizek lament that Chomsky was hesitant to say that Pol Pol in Cambodia was responsibe for the genocode in absence of clear evidence. Zizek noted that we can know this was the case without evidence, just by understandig how the Pol Pol regime worked. Could the same be true for US police (their history of racism etc.)? I am not sure the analogy works, but it's something to think about. Bottom line: when is the request for evidence more detrimental than beneficial?

> These two articles argue for the eaxct opposite. Or do they? See the **Disagreement Project**. Can they both be  right? I think so. But a closer look is needed. One article seems to suggest that today's views have become more extreme and thus there is a greater need to limit or regulate free expression, e.g. to avoid social disorder or hateful behaviour. So the claim is that it is isn't the case that the free speech is being attacked. What's the case is that mainstrean views out there (often right wing type of views) are now more extreme and thus their regulation (which would be inevitable no matter what) is more apparent. The other article instead relies on self-reporting by faculty members saying they feel they cannot speak openly. Perhaps, there are two different phemena going on?

## Policing, Defunding, More Crimes?

 > Looks like there has been spikes in killings during summer 2020. Why? There are many theories out there (more guns sold, stay at home orders, black lives matter protests). Vox gives space to this hypothesis:
 
 > "2) Depolicing led to more violence: In response to the 2014 and 2015 waves of Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality, officers in some cities pulled back, either out of fear that any act of aggressive policing could get them in trouble or in a counter-protest against Black Lives Matter. While protesters have challenged the crime-fighting effectiveness of police, there is a sizable body of evidence that more, and certain kinds of, policing do lead to less crime. Given that, some experts said that depolicing in response to protests could have led to more violence — what some in years past called the “Ferguson effect,” after the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police shooting of Michael Brown, and also seen in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray." [Trump claims crime is up in US cities. The truth is more complicated](https://www.vox.com/2020/8/3/21334149/trump-rnc-murders-crime-shootings-protests-riots)
 
 > The same point (i.e. police can reduce crime and thus defunding the polce means more crime) is made by Peter Moskos in this (video)[https://bloggingheads.tv/videos/59781] with Glenn Loury. See also article below.

Interestingly, propolice protesters are often portraied  as white people (see [this](https://time.com/5866336/police-supporters-black-lives-matter-protesters-brooklyn/) article by the Times), but in the video above, the propolice protesters are actually black.

## People as cases v. people as stories

- [Data, AI and Society - The Moral Legibility of Narrative and Case Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GMUsisUoso&list=PLdn0giYPTOk1bBDFhz047rrZ5t5I_Sju6&index=3&t=0s)

> DISTINCTION: people as case comparisons (compare traits, features, categories to make predictions about how people will behave, whether they will fall sick, etc.) VERSUS people as stories (collect causal informatiom about a single individual over time, what caused what, why they did this or that, their choices. 

> JUSTICE: Cases v. stories enable different sorts of conceptions of justice. Justice as **desert** is more related to stories. Justice as **actuarial fairness** (or comparative justice more generally) is more related to people as cases.

> ALGORITHMS mostly enable justice as case comparison/actuarial, not justice as story/desert.

> The distinction is interesting. But I do not buy the idea that algorithms are only about justice as case comparison. Algorhitms can also construct causal stories and select what features in a story are relevant for moral desert. Algorithms are just processes. I don't see why they would be confined to one form of justice only. 

> SIDE NOTE: Speaker said that we care about comparatve justce/racial disaparities because of the underlying stories. Racial disparities would not be an issue if there were not underlying stories of injustice. I thought this was insightful. 

- [The Moral Limits of Predictive Practices: The Case of Credit-Based Insurance Scores](https://sociology.stanford.edu/publications/moral-limits-predictive-practices-case-credit-based-insurance-scores)

## Definitions of Racism

> Different definitions of racism. Some focus on (a) racist attitudes of individuals. Others focus on "structures" or "policies" having (b) disproportionate negative/positive effects on different racial groups. There is a tendency to isolate (b) from (a) in the sense that (b) can be unjust or unfair even though (a) is missing. How can that be? 

> If we were to imagine a society that was completely devoid of racist attitudes in the present and past -- and thus (a) was missing -- but in which (b) existed, would that society be unjust (i.e. racist)?  It is not clear it would be. Imagine a society in which two groups of people decided to live in two separate locations, one closer to the coast and one more inland. Suppose this was a merely accidental choice. At some point, someone discovers a large gold mine inland. Those who happen to live inland become incredibly richer than those living on the coast. This is a society in which (b) exists without (a), but we would not call that society racist.  

> (SIDE COMMENT: Part of the problem is that the two groups have not been racialized. Racialization is a process of "category creation" by which certain exterior traits acquire social meanings. But we can suppose that the two groups, living in the different locations, have been racialized, no? One could ask: but can racialization be separated for a process in which one group is deemed inferior? Can there be "race" without one race having been considered inferior to the other? I guess there is White and Asian as races, but one need not be inferior to the other, at least there is no clear-cut idea about relative standing. So, yes, there can be racialization without inferiority.) 

> However, think about a society in which two groups are living in separate locations. There is segregation. One group thinks of the other as inferior. These beliefs of inferiority go away, but the two group still live in separate locations. As before, someone discovers a large gold mine inland. Those who happen to live inland become incredibly richer than those living on the coast. This is a society in which (b) exists without (a), but we would not call that society racist, right? 

> There are other examples. Take income inequality. If income is distributed unevent across racial groups, for whatever reason, and income inequality increases, some are going to be worse off than others. This is a just a mathematical fact. See the paper July 26 I comment on below: "How rising U.S. income inequality exacerbates racial economic disparities". Are the rising racial economic disparities racist if they due to the general (racially neutral in its intention) process of rising income inequality?

> Here is perhaps a plausible picture. At first, a racist system (due to racist attitudes) creates racial disparities, say in income or education. Then, other racial neutral phenomena take place (say, rising income inequality, college admission, etc). These racially neutral phenomena, however, adverserly affect some racial groups more than others. The effects then can be compounding. Is this structural racism? I am mostly interested in the conceptual picture here. The empirical facts are another matter.

- [The Dictionary Definition of Racism Has to Change](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/dictionary-definition-racism-has-change/613324/)

> "The 3.0 usage implies that calling racial disparities “racism” is natural because it is indisputable that **racial disparities** stem from bias-infused barriers. For example, many argue that black people lag behind white people in health indexes because of inadequate access to health care and supermarkets. The term racism is often applied to a case like this, even if white bias is not, or is no longer, the cause of the disparities. This is a tenet of much social science, but its pathway toward society-wide consensus would seem paved with thorns."

## Redlining

 > I am not sure what to think. One needs to get the historical record straight. Could redlinign still be happening today as many claim -- i.e. that banks lend less to blacks than whites? Or is it just becaue lending to blacks is riskier? When/how does one establish racial discrimination in lending? This is a long project. The financial crisis fits squarely into this story. Let's start with some City Journal stuff, then I'll look more closely at redlining lawsuits.  HYPOTHESIS 1: disproportionate rates of lending across races is due to differential risks of lending. HYPOTHESIS 2: If the government intervenes, by forcing lending at equal rates, there will spillover effects (higher rates of foreclosurres) and inequaliies will remerge on the other side. (ASIDE: Didn't the financial crisis disproportionately affect black families? Didn't black homeownership go down after the financial crisis?)

> RED-LINING. Shapiro notes that redlining was abolished in the 1960ies and cites studies showing that banks no longer lend at disproportionate rate across racial groups. The responders Aba and Preach respond by saying that there are studies ([here](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/remember-redlining-its-alive-and-evolving/433065/) and [here](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/we-exposed-modern-day-redlining-in-61-cities-find-out-whats-happened-since/)) shiwing that bank still discrmination.

> IMPLICIT BIAS. Shapiro says implicit bias studies are hard to quantify. Respondents agree. Maybe some more resources needed here?

> NAMES and HIRING. Shapiro makes the point that historically black names are no less likely to receive hiring call backs that historically white names. Hence, he argues, it's not about race, but about class. He is citing the study -- maybe the Pager study? The respondents comment that this is ridiculous. Shapiro takes "Jefferson" to be a historically black name.  The respondents point out that Jeffesrson does not sound black at all!

## Desegregating schools / tearing the apart the country? / antiracism as a framework

 - [Anti-racist Argument are Tearing Peopla Apart](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/meta-arguments-about-anti-racism/615424)
  > Interesting  discussion about what happened in a NYC school board meeting. Parents were discussing various motions, including eliminating screen schools or removing the NYPD designation for school security officers. There are arguments one way or another. The point of this article is (a) that anti-racist supporters are not willing to argue with those who do not subscribe to the anti-racist framework.  The other point of the article is that (b) the attitude described in (a) is wrong or objectionable. 
     
  > MY COMMENT: It is easy to agree with (b) if one subscribes to a standard liberal, say Millian framework of freech and open debate. But I think it is important to take (a) seriously. I think many people take (b) seriously and it is at least worth a try taking (a) seriously. Consider analogy with Nazism. It seems reaonable to say "I do not want to argue with a Nazi or a fascist becaue what they say is wrong---period". If we argue about anything, we will not get anywhere. I think this is true. This point is recognized by Aristotle and Aquinas -- contra impugnantes principia non est disputandum. What needs examining is whether *not* being an antiracist -- which for an antiracists means to be a racist, in the sense of Kendi's book "How to be an Antiracist" thought see this critical [piece](https://www.city-journal.org/how-to-be-an-antiracist) -- is as disruptive and inadmisisble as being a Nazi or a fascist. 
  
  > This is a point also Rawls emphasized. There are reasonable disagreements and unreasonable ones. Rawls thought that within a democratic society there can be reasonable disagreements. But can there be disagreements about the very principles of a democratic society? Technically, there could be. Perhasp there could be philosophical disagreements about democracy. But disagreement about democracy itsefl cannot be discussed within the institutions of a democratic society. One cannot go to congress and say "I am against democracy". You cannot just do that. At least, this seems the idea. There is a framework that must be shared. Democracy is that framework. Why could anti-racism not be the same sort of framework we should all abide? This in fact seems to be Kendi's idea -- i.e. to add an anti-racist democratic amendement. He is trying to make antiracism a "constitutional essential" in Rawls's terminology.

## Racial differences in school discipline

- [Understanding the Racial Discipline Gap in Schools, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858419844613)
 > Difficult article to fully grasp. Recent: 2019. Authors go through existing explanations, such as differences in behaviour and differences in school discrict practises, say black kids are more unruly and/or go to schools that are more punitive. But the authors point out the data about behavioural differences is hard to get -- what we have might be racially biased, so not a good yardstick for comparison.  
 
 > Two interestiong findings:
 
 > FINDING 1: Nonramdom sorting by race into more/less punitive schools explains part of the racial disparity. "We also identify a key mechanism underlying this disparity: the nonrandom sorting of Black students into school districts with higher suspension/expulsion rates." 
 
 > COUNTERFACTUAL: "Our estimates suggest that if Black students re-sorted into districts predominantly attended by White students in the state and received disciplinary sanctions at the average rates of those districts, the Black-White disciplinary gap would decline by 11% to 25% across grade levels."
 
 > FINDING 2: Hispanic-White disciplinary gaps are much less pronounced than white-black disparities. "Hispanic-White disciplinary gaps ... almost all of the gaps can be explained by school or district fixed effects and student-level control variables."
  
 > Authors make two claims (which seem to be in tension with one another):
 
 > CLAIM 1: "our decompositions reveal that about a third of the Black-White discipline gap remains unexplained due to unobserved heterogeneity, even after controlling for multiple student-level characteristics. In other words, if Black students exhibited the same average characteristics as White students (i.e., if Black students were on average as poor and had comparable past disciplinary histories) and were exposed to schools (districts) exhibiting similar average characteristics, the observed Black-White gap would attenuate but would not be eliminated. We argue that this finding provides *suggestive evidence of differential treatment discrimination*, which may be subsumed in omitted variables not captured in the model."
 
 > CLAIM 2: "Despite extensive covariate adjustment, about a third of the observed Black-White discipline gap remains unexplained due to unobserved heterogeneity. One potentially important source of unobserved heterogeneity is student behavior. Unfortunately, *our data do not capture information on student behavior*, and so we are unable to examine whether disciplinary gaps may be attributed to actual differences in student behavior."
 
 > So it looks like that unless we can control for student behaviour, we cannot claim that discrimination explains the racial differences in disciplinary punishment between white and black students, right? Studying differences in behaviour seems what's most needed. But how do you do that in an unbiased way?
 
 
 - [Unpacking the Drivers of Racial Disparities in School Suspension and Expulsion, 2018](https://fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/sites/fragilefamilies/files/wp18-04-ff.pdf)
 
 > Interesting paper. Compares three hypotheses: (1) difference between whites and blacks in school punishment are due to school discrict sorting; (2) differences are due to behaviour; (3) differences are due to discrimination. Article claims that they are all operating causes, but (3) accounts for a big part of the differences (39%), then (1), accounting for 15%, and finally (2), accounting for only 9%.
 
 > Paper is discussed in [this podcast](https://watson.brown.edu/research/2019/unpacking-drivers-racial-disparities-school-suspension-and-expulsion). 

 > PUZZLE: Here is an interesting bit of research that could be in the disagreement project: "Existing research provides conflicting evidence about the extent to which student behaviors account for the racial gap in suspension and expulsion, with some studies finding that
behavior accounts for almost **none** of the gap (Skiba et al. 2014) and other studies finding that it
accounts for nearly **all** of the gap (Wright et al. 2014)." (Quotation from the paper above) Does behaviour account for all or none at all of the difference in school punishment?

> MODELING ISSUE: Interestingly, these opposite conclusions aren't opposite. The article explains: 

> "Studies that **condition on being referred for sanction** and model the association between the severity of sanctions and suspension/expulsion typically find that differences in behavior account for very little of the racial gap in punishment"

> "Studies that use population-based data and do **not condition on referral** find that student behavior is strongly associated with suspension and expulsion" 

 - [Who Misbehaves? Claims that school discipline is unfairly meted out ignore actual classroom behavior](https://www.city-journal.org/html/who-misbehaves-15811.html)
 
  > Article from Mac Donald. Basic claim is that minority students are more unruly and violent in school and thus get punished more often. But what is the evidence? Both studies discussed above do not find evidence of this. In fact, the second study finds that differences in student behaviour explain very little of the differences in student discipline at school. But Mac Donald points out to interesting data: The Justice and Education Department's annual report [Indicators of School Crime and Safety, 2017](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018036.pdf)
  
  > She writes: "Black students self-reported being in a **physical fight** at school at over twice the rate of white students in 2015—a data point certainly relevant to the question of racial rates of school discipline.  Schools that were 50 percent minority or more reported weekly **gang activity** at nearly ten times the rate of schools where minorities constituted 5 percent to 20 percent of the population. Reports of **gang violence** in schools with less than 5 percent minority populations were too low to be usable statistically. Widespread weekly **disorder in classrooms** was reported in schools with at least 50 percent minority populations at more than five times the rate as in schools with 5 percent to 20 percent minorities. More than four times as many high-minority schools reported weekly **verbal abuse of teachers** compared with schools with a less than 20 percent minority student body. Widespread disorder and teacher abuse at schools with less than 5 percent minority populations was again too low to be statistically reliable. These facts are also relevant to judging the likelihood of student misbehavior and resulting discipline." 
  
  > She is not running a sophisticated statistical analysis, but it is plausible that, given these differences, differences in behaviour would emerge.

## Pipielines and Trails -- Are trails Land?

 - [US Forest Service v. Cowpasture River Preservation Association (2020)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/18-1584) -- majority written by Thomas, joined by others, dissent by Sotomayor and Kagan.

> HOLDING (from syllabus): "Because the Department of the Interior’s decision to assign responsibility over the Appalachian Trail to the National Park Service did
not transform the land over which the Trail passes into land within the National Park System, the Forest Service had the authority to issue the special use permit."

> Decision is not easy to decode. The holding is that the Forest Service can give permission for a pipeline to go through land, including the Appalachian trail, which is administered by the National Park service because the pipeline does not transform the trail itself (though it may transform the land). So the Park Service has no jurisdiction over the land, but only over the trail (which is not land). 

> Dispute about what is a trail and whether a trail is land.  If a trail is land and the pipeline impinges upon the trail/land (as Sotomayor argues), the Park Service has jurisdiction. If the trail is not land and the pipiline does not impinge upon the trail-as-different-from-the-land (as Thomas argues), the Forest service has jurisdiction. 

> Decision is a conceptual analysis of "trail" versus "land". Is this a textualist argument? It's interetsing to compare this decision with an earlier one, also in enviromental law, [TVA v. Hill (1987)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1977/76-1701). In that decision, we find a textualist argument, but also an argument about economic consequences v. protection of the environment. Have these topics disappeared from the court today?

## Algorithmic Fairness

 - (RWL) Interesting blog called [Algorithmic Fairness: On algorithmic fairness, discrimination, and disparate impact.](http://fairness.haverford.edu/index.html). It contains summaries of papers from the FAT* conference back in February 2019. 
 
 > It also contains an interesting "mathematical translation" of Gorsuch's argument in the Bostock decision (discussed below). 

## Discrimination because of sex v. sexual orientation

 > The recent US Supreme Court decision [Bostock v. Clayton County](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/17-1618) makes simple argument. If you cannot discriminate on the basis of sex (see 1964 Civil Right Act), then you cannot discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation either. Why? If you were to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, then you would also have to discriminate on the basis of sex (but you cannot do the latter, so you cannot do the former either). I wonder what gender theorists say about this! But this is judge Gorsuch -- a conservative! -- relyng on a textualist based argument. Let's quote him:
 
 > "It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no other reason than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague … The affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge."
 
 > It sounds like an argument an analytic philosopher would make! But look at what Alito and Kavanaugh said in response:
 
 > Alito: "In the mind of an employer who does not want to employ individuals who are attracted to members of the same sex, those two employees are not materially identical in every way but sex."
 
 > Kavanaugh: "Few in 1964 (or today) would describe a firing because of sexual orientation as a firing because of sex. As commonly understood, sexual orientation discrimination is distinct from, and not a form of, sex discrimination … In common parlance, Bostock and Zarda were fired because they were gay, not because they were men."
 
 > All three judges -- Alito, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch -- say they are using a textualist argument, but they arrive at such different conclusion. Perhaps, Gorsuch isn't really using a textualist argument. He seems to be doing some form of conceptual analysis or metaphysics. What is going on? This article -- [What ‘Because of Sex’ Really Means] (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/what-because-of-sex-really-means/613099/) -- gives the broader context.  
 
 > All in all, interesting. It could be part of the disagreement project, as well!

## Statistical Correlates to Crime - Theft

## Clinical/Statistical controversy

 - [Comparative Efficiency of Informal (Subjective, Impressionistic) and Formal (Mechanical, Algorithmic) Prediction Procedures: The Clinical–Statistical Controversy]
 
  > From the abstract: "Empirical comparisons of the accuracy of the two methods (136 studies over a wide range of predictands) show that the mechanical method is almost invariably equal to or superior to the clinical method: Common antiactuarial arguments are rebutted, possible causes of widespread resistance to the comparative research are offered, and policy implications of the statistical method’s superiority are discussed."
  
  > This is an interesting debate in psychology. It should be discussed in my book. (Did I just say "book"? Ah!) I do, however, believe that the debate does not apply to questions of statistical evidence in the law. Looks like that in psychology the comparaison is between (a) mechanical/formula based decisions versus (b) human-based decisions where both decisions rely on roughly the same information (actually, the human decision relies on more, perhaps subjective, information). So the comparison concerns  two different processses of understanding the same body of information, not two different bodies of information (say statistical versus non-statistical information). But still, the debate is worth exploring. It could be part of the disagreement project too! See below.

## The Disagreement Project

 > The world isn't black and white. Nuance is important, though some say [Fuck nuance!](https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf)  At any rate, this  project would pair academic papers that argue one against the other or reach opposute conclusions about the same issue.  Both papers should be carefully argued, intellectually honest and rigorous. Yet they reach opposite conclusions! This could have pedagogical value, and be also an invitation to humility and respect toward others who may disagree with you. To be continued. Some ideas of great debates: Beccaria v. Mills on the death penalty. Allen v. Langbein on comparative legal scholarship. Allen v. Kaye on legal probabilism. Pryor v. Wright on dogmatism in epistemology. Risinger v. ? on wrongful conviction rate.  This could turn into a website for research, teaching and wider readership. Exciting! Part of it could be about famous dissents in US Supreme Court opinions. What else?  Actuarial/clinical methods.

## Big Data, Reference Class Problem and Inferences about Individuals

- [Big data and the reference class problem: what can we legitimately infer about individuals?](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/101290/1/Greene_big_data_and_the_reference_class_problem_published.pdf)

> Nice simple paper. It uses Dahlman criteria for assessing the acceptabilitu of generalizations, namely: (1) Is the generalization true? (2) Is the generalization robust in light of counterevidence; (3) Is the reference class homogenous or not? (4) Could reliance on the generalization put certain groups at a disadvantage? It uses these questions to asess teh use of Big Data. Looks loike Big Data do not fare that well. 

> Consider generalization about crime prediction, say about people wiht prior convictions. Generalizaton like "people with prior conviction of X are more likely to commit X than others". Is this true? The authors writes: " what we really
want to know is whether membership of the target class is higher in the reference
class than in the population in general. However, not all crimes are discovered,
reported, or recorded. Particularly for less serious crimes, we do not know the extent
of criminality in the population at large. This makes generalisations linking reference
classes with target classes problematic. Any statistical relationship between the
reference and target classes is likely to be untrue because we will not be sure that
membership of the target class is higher in the reference class than in the population
in general. An additional worry is the incidence of false convictions. Any statistical
relationships based on characteristics shared by convicted criminals will include the
characteristics of wrongly convicted individuals. By its very nature, the incidence of
false convictions is difficult to judge.
Furthermore, in this case, we also need to know how many convicted
criminals do not have the characteristics defining the reference class. What
percentage of criminals share characteristics with the reference class? "

## Hitler and the US laws

- [What America Taught the Nazis](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/what-america-taught-the-nazis/540630/)
   > This is a review of a book by respected legal historian James Q. Whitman, title "Hitler’s American Model". Quite a title. The basis thesis---but I have not read teh book--is that Nazi jurists took inspiration from the United States system of racists laws. Another [review](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/03/08/review-james-q-whitman-hitlers-american-model-united-states-and-making-nazi-race) of the same book notes how racist laws are not just an incident of US legal system---they are essentila to it:
   > The error here, as Whitman sees it, comes from treating the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson as the primary or quintessential legal component of racial oppression in the United States, and presumably the one Nazi jurists would have looked to in reshaping German policy. But, according to Whitman, “American race law” in the 19th and much of the 20th century: " sprawled over a wide range of technically distinct legal areas … [including] Indian law, anti-Chinese and -Japanese legislation, and disabilities in civil procedure and election law …. Anti-miscegenation laws on the state level featured especially prominently … [as] did immigration and naturalization law on the federal level"

## Algorithmic Bias

- [The A-level results injustice shows why algorithms are never neutral](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/08/level-results-injustice-shows-why-algorithms-are-never-neutral)
   > Nothing particularly relevlatory here. The claim seems to be that algorithms may entrench disparities as they rely on biased data. But the example is quite interesting. Quotation: "Yesterday (13 August) was A-level results day in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Owing to the cancellation of A-level and GCSE exams, the English regulator Ofqual’s statistical model determined students’ grades, based on their school’s recent exam history, as well as each student’s prior exam performance. This caused outrage: because Ofqual’s model seemed crude, because some students were cheated out of the opportunity to prove their teachers wrong by exceeding expectations, and because nearly 40 per cent of A-level results were downgraded."
   
   > So they are using an algorithm to predict and assign grades to students? That's pretty cool, or awful. 
   
   > The big problem for tha author: "Statistical models often pick up on large-scale historical patterns or racial, gender and class inequalities and replicate them as data patterns, while simultaneously endowing these patterns with an air of certainty, neutrality and objectivity. After all, numbers don’t have agendas, right? This is a dangerous illusion. How we choose to use statistical models, which questions we ask (and don’t ask) when we “simply look at the numbers” depends on political assumptions and priorities. If we do not carefully consider who merits the benefit of the doubt – who typically gets given more leeway to prove their potential due to their proximity to prestige, and who is more likely to be considered an inevitable product of a bad environment – then BAME students and working-class students will be further disadvantaged by the use of statistical inference methods."
   
   > That's an interesting point. But I feel the argument is not completely worked out. How does the argument work? Is it that disadvantaged students are more likely to be judged by the algorithm worse than they actually perform compared to other students? Or is it that disadvantaged students should be assessed more carefully -- or more leniently? -- than others to give them the benefit of the douhbt and thus more opportunities down the road in life? The assumptions of the argument are not spelled out by the author. This is a journalistic piece, though.

## How to Study Racial disparities

- [How to Study Racial Disparities](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-study-racial-disparities/)
   > Interesting piece. *Claim 1*: studies that control for race are meaningless. If race is assigned at birth and influences what comes next (schooling, neighborhood, etc.), it makes no sense to ask whether disaprities in say, income, are due to race v. education. It would like asking whether different mortality rates are due to smoking v. lung cancer. Well smoking (read: race) affects lung cancer (read: education)!
   
   > Quotation: "Consider the following analogy: if researchers set out to investigate whether smoking leads to death, but controlled for whether someone gets lung cancer, they might find that smoking doesn’t increase mortality—because they’ve effectively removed an important pathway by which smoking influences health. What’s more, by controlling for lung cancer, they’re now comparing the life spans of smokers who don’t get lung cancer, who are likely to be unusually healthy, to nonsmokers without lung cancer (and comparing nonsmokers who get lung cancer, a highly unusual group, to smokers who get lung cancer)."
   
   > This analogy with police killings and Fryer work is not completely clear, though. Quotation:" Similar issues abound in the study of race and policing. Take the recent debate over whether there is evidence of racism in American policing. Roland Fryer, an economist at Harvard, found that police shoot white, Black and Hispanic Americans whom they’ve stopped at equal rates. However, as political scientists Dean Knox, Will Lowe, and Jonathan Mummolo point out, if there is initial discrimination in who gets stopped in the first place, estimating racial disparities in how people are treated once they’ve been stopped becomes much more complicated—especially since police officers are more likely to stop Black and Hispanic people than white people, and more of those stops are unjustified. If Black people are stopped by police for lesser (or nonexistent) offenses, “equal treatment” in terms of the use of force would actually indicate deeply unequal policing overall. Being stopped by the police is “post-treatment” to race, and failing to account for this bias can lead to erroneous conclusions that may mask the extent of racism in American institutions."
   
   > That is a different issue, I think. We have two different probabilities here. (a) Probability of x being shot by police if black versus (b) probability of x being shot by police if black AND stopped. Both are interesting. If (b) isn't different for whites and blacks, but (a) is, this suggests that the racial bias in police shootings does not exist after te stop but before the stop (say, in the decision about whom to stop). If so, this seems a pretty interesting piece of information. And Fryer's work helps us to see that. What's wrong with that?
   
   > But perhpas the authors have in mind something different. The claim is that whites and blacks are stopped for differenr reasons -- often there are serious reasons for stopping whites, and often there are not so serious reasons for stopping blacks. There are a lot of pretext stops of blacks. Now, if the populations of those who are stopped by the police are so different acrosso races, but we still get an equal probability of police hosting across the two populations, then this is evidence of unequael treatment, not equal treatment. Seems an interesting point. Worth thinkign about! I would expect, however, that Fryer did control for such differences in the populations of those who are stopped. This shoud be checked. 
   
   > *Claim 2*: let's think of race as a cluster of microproperties (skin tone, hair, name, accent etc.) and let's study differences in outcome due to those microproperties, leaving the general label "race" aside. This will allow for more fine-grained studies of the causes of racial disparities and we will be able to "fix the problem" more effectively. For example, see the [late Pager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devah_Pager)'s research on names and hiring preferences.  She uses names, not race directly. So her result is more accurate. Interestingly, that's also its weakness because some people could say "but a name does not really tell you about someone's race!" So we are in a dilemma here.

Perhas, this way we can create safer and better serviced communites ... and crime will go down. The idea is simple. Does it work? Are things so simple? What is undeniable, however, is that too much public resources -- billions of dollars! -- are spent on the police. Why?

A [closer look](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/what-police-spending-data-can-and-cannot-explain-amid-calls-defund-police) at state and city budgets shows that they do not spend that much on the police. The data must be aggregated along different lines of spending and if one does that, it seems that police spending makes on average 4-6% of city and state budget, not an a big number.

 ## US woke scholarship, American cultural hegemony
  
 - [Beyoncé and the Heart of Darkness](https://africasacountry.com/2019/09/beyonces-heart-of-darkness)
     >  I think the point of this article, written by an African intellectual, is to say that "woke scholarship" or "woke music" (see Beyonce) is another expression of Western American cultural imperialism. Africa is looked through the lenses of American history, be the history of white people or the history of black Americans.  As the subtitle says "Few black thinkers and creatives in the United States seem able to grapple with the implications of their Americocentrism in relation to Africa."
      
     > I think this point is well taken.  But the author suggests that we should look at Africans simply as "people". I wonder, isn't this another way to essentialize Africans? Isn't "people" another concept created by European philosophers? Wouldn't that be another way of Americocentrism? After all, the author is saying that we should look at Africans as "individuals" -- another key idea in American society. Perhaps -- and more charitably --  the author is saying that we should look at Africans for who they are, however they are, whatever they are. That's hard. And is it even possible? Does it even make sense? We always look at people through our lenses. Perhpas we should be aware of these lenses as much we can and try to remove them--and Americans writers and creatives do not do that. Yes, perhpas that's what the author meant!

  > Interesting US Sup Ct case, especially Thomas' concurring opinion. His point is that abortion in that 1920ies had eugenics motives. As it turns out, even today black children are aborted at disproportionately higher rates than white children. So abortion is still fullfilling its eugenics motives (keeping in mind that in the 1920ies eugenists thought that black people were inferior and thus their natality rate had to be limited, hence the need for abortion as eugenic tool). 
  
  > Thomas makes another point. Just as it was wong for eugenists to infer the inferiority of black people from disparate rates of achievement (disparate rates of achievement can after all be due to all sorts of factors, not racial inferiority), similarly it is wrong for us today to infer racism from racially disparate rates of achievemtns. The two forms of reasoning follow the same logic, says Thomas. It is not exactly clear how, but it is an interetsing point nonetheless. Thomas cites Sowell, footnote 4. Denial of the complexity of the human experience is the culprit here. ("Both eugenics and disparate-impact liability rely on the simplistic and often faulty assumption that "some one particular factor is the key or dominant factor behind differences in outcomes" and that one should expect "an even or random distribution of outcomes ... in the absence of such complicating causes as genes or discrimination." Sowell 25, 87.

Id., at 83; see id., at 87-149 (explaining how statistics and linguistics can be used to obscure realities). Just as we should not assume, based on bare statistical disparities, "that the Negro lacks in his germ-plasm excellence of some qualities which the white races possess," Applied Eugenics 285, "[w]e should not automatically presume that any institution with a neutral practice that happens to produce a racial disparity is guilty of discrimination until proved innocent."

  > Challenge: is behaviour heritable? 
  
  > Goal is to maximize passing down one's gene, via (building block 1) individual selection (maximization of reproduction), or (building block 2) kin selection (since we share genes with twin brothers, 100%, broters, 1/2, and cousins, 1/8 of genes) by allowing one's of our kin to reproduce instead of us, or via (building block 3) cooperation.
  
   > Reciprocal altruism and cooperation. Rock/paper/seazar scenarios. Requires animal who are able to recognize one another over time. But this also hapens with bacteria. There could be cheating during this reciprocal cooperation.  
   
   > When do you cooperate and when do you cheat? Game theory. Prisoner's dilemma. Tit for tat strategy is the most optimal (start cooperating, coooperate next if the other cooperated, but cheat if they did not cooperate, and then go back to cooperate if they cooperated before). This strategy drives all the other strategies into extinction.  But this strategy is vulnerable to signal error. Robert Axelrod. 
   
   > Better strategy. Forgiving tit for tat. If cheating comes up too for long, forgive in one round (leaving open possibility of signal error, the other cooperated but you mstook for cheating). This prevails over strict tit for tat. 
   
   > But forgiving Tit for Tar is vulnerable to exploitation if the other doe snot forgive. 
   
   > Even better strategy: start with strict tit for tat, and after a while without being cheated, then switch to forgiving tit for tat (you trust the other).
   
   > But Pavlov Tit for Tat could exploit the earlier Tit for Tat. 
   
   > "The Optimal Benefit of Perceived Madness" by Ellsberg.
   
   > Biologists looked at this formal work. Do animals behave in the way described by game theory?
   
   > Example 1: Vampire. System of altruism.  Bats feed everybody's babies with blood they found. Others reciprocate next time. Blood vampire commune.  Tit for Tat. But if there is seeming cheating if one bat (signal error), altruistic behavior is interrupted. 
   
   > Example 2: Fish. Tit for tat strategy. 
   
   > Example 3: Fish species that would change sex. 
   
   > So optimal behaviour (tit for that strategy) is selected by natural selection logic 
   
   > Exceptions: Naked mole rat. Big cooperative colonies. Lots of work. Reciprocities all over. There were one or two animals in the colony that were not doing any work. But no punishment for them. Why? There is another game going on. Those who did no work usually had the job of protecting colonies against floods and water. Work diversification. Multiple games going on.  Real world is complicated.
   
   > Further complication. Mutation (stratgey changing). James Holland, first PhD in computer science, Michigan.
   
   > We can look at animal behaviour and use the three building blocks to understand animal behaviour.  
   
   > Higher level of aggresion in males if male body size is bigger than female body. 
   Also, more reproductive variability. 
   Also, less male parental behaviour. 
   Also, less able to express emotions.
   
   > If body size is the same across genders, females will look for males who are competent at parental behavior, able to to brign food, etc. 
   More monogamous species
   
   > Tuornament species (high variability across genders, e.g. peacook feather) versus parebonding species (similarities across genders)

> *outcome variables*: "Our analysis focuses on the expected outcomes for children with parents at the national 25th percentile. The main outcomes we examine are: individual income rank in 2014–2015 for black boys, when they were aged 31–37 years; the expected fraction of black boys incarcerated on April 1, 2010; and the expected fraction of black girls who had children as teenagers. Each of these outcomes is of fundamental interest to researchers in the social sciences."

> *explanatory variables*: "Our explanatory variables are constructed from the Census; the Community Survey of the PHDCN, which interviewed a representative sample of Chicago residents about their neighborhood social environments in 1995 and 2002 (combined N of ∼12,000); violent crime rates per 100,000 population from 1995 to 2000, derived from offenses reported by citizens to the police; incarceration rates per population from 1995 to 2000, derived from prison admission data; and lead exposure among children from 1995 to 1997, derived from more than 150,000 blood-level tests conducted by Chicago’s health department."

> quotations: "There is considerable variation across the city: among majority African American Census tracts, for instance, the expected income rank for a boy with parents at the 25th percentile varies by more than 19 percentage points."
  
 
 > "By combining a fuller set of measures of neighborhood context and child outcomes, we have shown that theoretically relevant aspects of the social and physical environment, most notably exposure to violence, lead, and incarceration, directly predict lower intergenerational income mobility, adult incarceration, and teenage birth among children who grow up poor. Although the magnitude of association and the explanatory power of toxicity is similar for blacks and whites, exposure levels, in Chicago at least, are markedly different: the most-exposed white tracts in our sample had levels comparable to the least-exposed black tracts, potentially accounting for racial disparities in social mobility."

The stagnation between 1960 and 2010 of the racial gap in family income, as measured by the median or mean, can be accounted by two concurrent phenomena: (a) a closing of the racial gap as measured by family income rank toghether with (b) widening economic inequality (i.e. concentration of income to the top percentiles of the income distribution).

- (RWL) [Income Inequality and the Persistence of Racial Economic Disparities](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci_v5_182to205.pdf)

  > ABSTRACT: More than 50 years after the Civil Rights Act, black–white family income disparities in the
United States remain almost exactly the same as what they were in 1968. This article argues that a
key and underappreciated driver of the racial income gap has been the national trend of rising income
inequality. From 1968 to 2016, black–white disparities in family income rank narrowed by almost
one-third. But this relative gain was negated by changes to the national income distribution that
resulted in rapid income growth for the richest—and most disproportionately white—few percentiles
of the country combined with income stagnation for the poor and middle class. But for the rise in
income inequality, the median black–white family income gap would have decreased by about 30
percent. Conversely, without the partial closing of the rank gap, growing inequality alone would
have increased the racial income gap by 30 percent

- [Racial Inequality Trends and the Intergenerational Persistence of Income and Family Structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4598060/)

  >  Interesting article. It uses computer simulations as methodology. It compares actual data about racial wealth disparities in 2008 with simulated data based on different parameters and hypotheses. 
  
  > Two main hypotheses about the persistance of racial wealth/income inequalities from 1968 to 2008. One hypothesis: intergenerational wealth transmission. Rich familites tend to trasmit their wealth down the line. Hypothesis two: changes in family structure and labor market, in particular, more single families and decline of unskilled workfprce and rise of highly technical workforce.  The paper basically argues for hypothesis two. 
  
  > Looks like that, if we hold fixed family structure (say, single family or two parent family), racial disaprities in family are not as stark today. Reduction of racial wealth disparities within the same family structure is more marked than if we lookd at disaprities in the aggregate. (Is this another version of Simpson's paradox, i.e. no discriminatory pattern in subgroups, but an overall discriminatory pattern in the aggregate?) 
  
  > So the proposed explanation, roughly, is this: (a) income disparities were equalizing from 1968 to today, but family structure was not. Black women were becoming more independent and more black single families appeared compared to white single families (though the pattern seems to affect both racial groups). (b)  Single faimilies tend to be poorer. So, by putting toghether (a) and (b), here you have the explanation. 
  
  > Also interesting is that the author looks at the entire wealth/income distribution, not just the median or mean as comonly done.

I don't think that right is in jeopardy. I did not see any supreme court case that demands an encroachment of that right. If there is a problam with free speehc, it is about social norms and social sanctions, not about the law or the constitution. Examples: the [Princeton letter](https://www.thecollegefix.com/princeton-faculty-accuse-school-of-rampant-anti-blackness-issue-list-of-48-demands/) and the [letter against Pinker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZqWl5grm_F5Kn_0OarY9Q2jlOnk200PvhM5e3isPvY/edit) (the accusation being that "Dr. Pinker as a public figure has a pattern of drowning out the voices of people suffering from racist and sexist violence, in particular in the immediate aftermath of violent acts and/or protests against the systems that created them.
"). They signal that certain points of view in academia might not be welcome any longer.

  Interesting Gorsuch's argument that Title VII CRA 1968 prohibits discrimination by sexual orientation b/c it prohibits discrimination by race
    
   >  it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer's mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague….

Disappointing exchange. Glenn and Tricia seem unable to have a reasoned conversation. Other speakers tried to create more common grounds. Glenn's main criticism of Tricia's structural racism SR approach is centered on the idea that SR is not a sophisticated enough theory to explain.  Another point he made is that--politically and moving foward--SR has little to offer. It is easy to get into polarities, such as individual responsibility vs. community responsability. Tricia adn Glenn suggest we overcome polarities.

     > We assessed racial disparities in policing in the United States by compiling and analysing a dataset detailing nearly 100 million traffic stops conducted across the country. We found that black drivers were less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a ‘veil of darkness’ masks one’s race, suggesting bias in stop decisions. Furthermore, by examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for searching white drivers. Finally, we found that legalization of recreational marijuana reduced the number of searches of white, black and Hispanic drivers—but the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was still lower than that for white drivers post-legalization. Our results indicate that police stops and search decisions suffer from persistent racial bias and point to the value of policy interventions to mitigate these disparities.

Their development of an alternative approach to making decisions the face of uncertainty about the future is less well-specified. A lot of material is included on the way people reason by narratives, the use of small groups to exchange opinions, and the use of Taleb's positioning approach of clipping downside risks and being open to upside risks. There is some mention of scenario thinking and trying to make robust and resilient decisions in the face of uncertainty but this discussion is not well-developed as a practical proposition. I think the authors need to find out more about scenario methods beyond those of Schoemaker. There is a lot of recent stuff about combining decision analysis ( SMART) with scenarios and a lot about developing causality in scenario storylines, etc. The new Wiley journal "Futures & Foresight Science" is a good way into this developing area."

- [The Anti-Lockdown Protests Prove Police Know How to Treat Protesters Fairly](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/police-response-george-floyd-minneapolis-shutdowns.html)


   > When faced with angry, predominantly white crowds, police agencies have proven that they are capable of discipline and a reasonable reaction to a perceived threat. It’s not crazy to wonder, had the police shown up to the anti–police brutality protests with the same level of restraint, might the escalation have been avoided? Riots are an inevitable consequence of systematic instability, or, as Martin Luther King Jr. called them, “the language of the unheard.” It’s not hard to see how meeting protesters who have come to stand against excessive use of force with an excessive use of force would lead to nowhere good.

     > Why are high- and middle-income white families so much wealthier than Black families with the same incomes? We note a few reasons. White families receive much larger inheritances on average than Black families. Economists Darrick Hamilton and Sandy Darity conclude that inheritances and other intergenerational transfers “account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other demographic and socioeconomic indicators.”
        
    > The solutions to the Black-white wealth gap—and the policies that address racial inequity more generally—are largely outside the scope of this post. But the analysis above points to at least one type of reform: taxation of income from wealth. The income from inheritances, and from wealth more generally, is taxed at an inequitably low rate, especially when compared to earnings.
        
        

- [A Prosecutor's Use of Inconsistent Factual Theories of a Crime](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3607&context=flr)

    > Prosecutors face a dilemma when two people engage in criminal
activity, but only one of the perpetrators commits the most serious
offense. In some cases, the evidence clearly establishes that the most
serious offense, oftentimes murder, was committed by only one
person. The evidence frequently does not, however, confirm which of
the suspects committed this offense. Moreover, circumstantial
evidence often suggests that either suspect could have committed the
offense. Thus, knowing that one of the two suspects committed the
offense, prosecutors face a difficult choice: they can choose not to
charge either suspect, charge only one of the suspects, or charge both
suspects with the same criminal act.

  > Real Estate. For centuries, members of R1 systematically targeted the
economic resources of members of R2 for (unjust) suppression, first
through a state-supported system of slavery, then through a statesupported system of segregation. Eventually, there was a racial rapprochement, where all state-supported means of R2’s economic repression (including criminal laws, voting rights, and tax-and-transfer schemes) were abolished. However, the rapprochement was not complete in the sense that no reparations were made to members of R2, and therefore the postrapprochement era begins with R1s uniformly
having more wealth than R2s. Two hundred years later, there are no
longer any attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs, among either R1s or R2s,
which we would ordinarily identify as racist. However, there also is
no change in mortgage policies, which ensures that more, and more
beneficial, mortgages go to those with better credit ratings, and better
credit ratings are assigned to those with greater assets. As a direct
result of this state of affairs, R2s still have fewer good homes, less
wealth, and a weaker sense of economic security than R1s have. (p. 72-73)

  >  The institutional forces at work in Real Estate can apparently be
legitimately described as racist: because the two races do not start, even
after the rapprochement, at just relative starting points, and because
the relevant credit institutions perpetuate existing inequality, those institutions perpetuate (indeed, exacerbate) a socioeconomic structure in
which members of R1 systematically and unjustly have greater access to
housing, to a comparatively accessible vehicle for growing personal
wealth, and not least to a source of perceived security and well-being
than do members of R2. Thus, while, by hypothesis, the mortgage industry has policies that are, other things being equal, just, other things
are not equal, because of the society’s racist past. Further, imagine that
everyone is well aware of the problem and wants to fix it, and at the
moment they are just waiting to vote in a referendum that will select
policies aimed at solving the problem, perhaps to determine the exact
monetary amount that should be paid to each R2 in order for their
society to have a racially just economic distribution. So, despite the fact
that no one agent is racist at this moment, a troubled past means that
their otherwise just institutions perpetuate an unjust racial inequity. This
seems to qualify those institutions as racist. (p. 73)

- [Structural Racism, Institutional Agency, and Disrespect](https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&context=rel_fac)

  > The Toxic Doughnut Hole: On the outskirts of a major U.S. city, a predominately black
community is literally surrounded by landfills, sewage plants, chemical refineries, and
toxic dumps. The air, water, and soil are polluted at levels three to four times what is
considered safe. Rates of cancer, asthma, and emphysema, among other illnesses, are
more than double that of the general population. Furthermore, the industries surrounding
this community are inspected and cited less frequently by regulatory bodies than
comparable industries in white communities, and when they are cited for regulatory
infractions, the fines levied are consistently less than those imposed for comparable
violations in white communities. Let us suppose that the directors of these industries lack
any beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors that we would normally consider racist. The
motivation for locating their facilities here is purely economic: lower real estate prices,
lower taxes, favorable zoning regulations, and etc. Let us suppose further that in locating
their facilities here, these industries actually sought out the input and consent of the
neighboring community, thus extending them due respect. And let us suppose that, as an
economically depressed community desperate for jobs and tax revenue, the community
consented to the construction and location of the facilities. (p. 9)

  > Why are zoning regulations so lax? Perhaps because
impoverished communities are also frequently politically disenfranchised, and so
raise fewer effective complaints than better-situated communities. When one
begins to ask these questions, what emerges is a picture of some populations
systematically disadvantaged by various interrelated barriers, and other
populations systematically advantaged by those same barriers. That toxic waste,
landfills, and etc. are disproportionately located in poor, minority communities
means that they are disproportionately absent from well-off white communities,
who also probably benefit more from the products and processes that produce
such waste ... Put simply, when dealing with finite
resources, a disadvantage for one group creates an advantage for everyone else.
This principle is straightforward, but frequently those who are willing to admit
that racial minorities face significant disadvantages resist making the logical step
of acknowledging that non-minorities thus enjoy significant advantages. That
these advantages and disadvantages track along racial lines means that they are
not based on merit, just transfer, or any other plausible criteria for distributive
justice. In short, they are undeserved. This is why they represent an injustice. (p. 11)

    > How do we act morally at a time of immense collective uncertainty, without pretending that we know how to transform this uncertainty into calculable odds? Trolley-like trade-off arguments prevent us from facing these questions. When they warn about “deaths of despair,” for example, they sneak in ipso facto precisely what needs to be changed about the American status quo; indeed, what the pandemic could serve as a lever for changing — namely the casualization and systemic precarity of the labor force (Griesbach, 2020), the dismantling of social services and community support, the declining trust in institutions. These are the “rails” on which their trade-off argument proceeds. 
 
   > In the Judeo-Christian tradition there is a counter-fable. This is the famous Rabbinical story, of which the Church Fathers were fond as well, about Moses and the lamb. While herding a flock of sheep through the desert, so the story goes, Moses noticed that a single little lamb was lost. Risking the safety of the whole herd, he sets out on his own to find and save the single lamb. Seeing this, God selects him to be the leader of his people because, God says, he has the quality of mercy.

  > Unable or unwilling to accommodate our nation’s need to deliver superior higher education to millions of new students, most major research universities, both public and private, appear content to maintain the status quo and seek prestige through ever-increasing exclusivity. But success in maintaining excellence in a small number of elite institutions does little to advance our society or ensure continued national competitiveness. The issue of broad accessibility to research-grade academic platforms is far more urgent than policymakers realize, even those on the national stage charged with advancing higher education policy. Our national discussion on higher education must not simply focus on the production of more college graduates. Mere access for greater numbers to rudimentary forms of instruction will not deliver desired societal outcomes ... The imperative is to ensure that far more students —an order of magnitude more—have access to research-grade academic platforms that deliver advanced skills commensurate with the demands of the knowledge economy.
