## Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)

Going back to the landmark Sup. Ct. decision on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and being transgender (SOT for short). [Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/17-1618). While these expressions are not explicitly present in Title VII, the Court held that discrminating on the basis of SOT is discrmination on the basis of sex, and thus prohibited by Title VII. The test for discrimination based on sex in the emplyment context is this:

> If the employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee’s sex when deciding to discharge the employee—--put differently, if changing the em­ployee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the em­ployer---a statutory violation has occurred.

Note the but-for causation counterfactual test: had the employee been of a different sex, would have they been differently treated (fired/hired) by the emplyoer? If yes, a violation of Title VII has occurred.

Now here is the key passage:

> it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer intentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee’s sex, and the affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge.

The way I understand this is by running the appropriate counterfactual test for but-for causation. The two employees are indistinguishable---they both like men, equally qualified, etc.---but one is male (and thus homosexual) and the other female (thus heterosexual). If the male emplyoee is fired because of their sexual preference towards men, then had they been female they would not have been fired (since their sexual preference towards men would not be problematic). So, being fired becaue of sexual preference towards men (discrimination based on sexual preference) implies being fired because of being man (discriminatiom based on sex).

> Or take an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. Again, the individual employee’s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.

In the transgender case the reasoning seems similar. The two employees are identical except that one identifies as female at birth while the other transitioned from male to female. If the employer fires the latter, but would not have fired the former, this means that had the emplyoee being female (at birth), they would not have been fired. So, again discrimination based on transgenderism is also discrimination based on sex. 

## Connecting with Hu's work

I wonder what Lily Hu's vignettes have to say about that? Here is one case from her 2022 dissertation:

> AUDIT STUDY I: Skirt Interview - Two actors, one taken to be male and the other female, present identical resumes, answer interviewer questions identically, and affect the same tone, mannerisms, and general personality traits (as best as they can). The male actor also dons the same dress and wears the same facial makeup as the female actor; both actors wear skirts and facial makeup to their interviews. (p. 86)

Suppose one actor is hired but the other is not. Or suppose you can track the disparity across alike cases. So what is the cause of the decision?  It is sex/gender or something else? Hu seems to think, if I remember right, that it's not clear here whether the discrmination was because of sex/gender or because of failure to follow gender conforming rules. In fact, it's  likely that the discrimination was becaue of the gender rules, not sex/gender.  But a manipulationist account of causation -- keep everything the same, just change sex/gender -- would say that the cause here is sex/gender, not failure of conformity with gender norms. 

But, interestingly, the US Sup. Ct. does not find anything problematic here. The counterfactual test above says that Hu's case is a case of sex discrimination. 

## Because of sex v. because of gender non conformity

During the oral argument, the Justices talked about cases involving women behaving according to male gender norms or men behaving according to female gender norms. Some of the Justices seemed to think that, if these individuals were discriminated because of their gender non-conformity, they would be discriminated---at least in part---because of their sex/gender. Here is the lawyer Pamela S. Karlan, who was representing Bostock:

> I'm simply saying that if a man and a woman both wanted to sew and you fire the man who loves sewing and you don't fire the woman who loves sewing, that's discrimination pure and simple, sex discrimination.

So, there seems to be no issue that, if someone fails to conform with gender norms and they are discriminated because of that, they are also discriminated because of their sex/gender. Justice Alito, however, disagrees:

> The -- the point is that discrimination on the basis of sex in the sense that Congress understood it in 1964 is a different concept from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

## The sex discrimination test in Bostock isn't logically sound 

A blog critical of the opinion came out right after. 

- [Analysis
Justice Gorsuch’s Misguided Sex Discrimination Opinion Fails Logic Test](https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/06/19/justice-gorsuchs-misguided-sex-discrimination-opinion-fails-logic-test/)

It gives good counterexamples:

> Suppose a female lifeguard is fired because she wears a swimsuit bottom but refuses to wear a top. No doubt, “changing the employee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the em­ployer” and her sex was a “but-for” cause of the decision. Yet her termination was not sex discrimination provided it held males and females to the same standard: A male lifeguard who exposed private parts would have similarly been fired.

> Suppose a male employee at a fitness center repeatedly goes into the women’s locker room and is fired. Now it’s true that “changing the em­ployee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the em­ployer” and that his sex was a “but-for” cause of the decision to fire him. But the negative treatment the employee faced was not sex discrimination provided the employer imposed no double standard for men and women, such as a bathroom policy that imposed the same burden on men and women: Each is prevented from entering the opposite sex’s private space.

So these seem to be good counterexamples. And it does not help to say that discrmination also requires harm. There is harm in this cases because the emplyoee is fired -- clearly a harm. But it is not a harm that, intuitively, can be traced back to sex. Male and females lifeguards are not differently harmed (fired) because of their sex.  

## Differential treatment that is unevenly harmful for people of different sexes

The author of the blog post offers an alternative:

> To be a case of sex discrimination, sex must not only be a “but-for” cause of differential treatment, but that differential treatment must also entail disadvantageous terms or conditions to which members of only one sex are subjected. The simplistic test that Gorsuch puts forth looks for the “but-for” cause and “negative” treatment, but it doesn’t link the two: It doesn’t look for disadvantages directed at individuals of only one sex. He’s offered half a theory of sex discrimination.

> The court in Oncale quoted Ginsburg to explain: “The critical issue, Title VII’s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.”

# Personalized law v precision medicine

We have personalized law, a new trend, though not so new perhaps. Legal rules tailored to individual, based on their needs, risk tolerance, metal capacities, etc. What are the ethical and legal implications of that? Does it make sense at all?

And then we have precision (personalized?) medicine.

# Nations and International Law

Interesting article about why nations do/should obey international law. Seems opuzzling. If law is binding by some state authority, then no state authority issues internatinal law. Might be a good addition or topic for the next version of my philosophy of law class.
