# Personalized law v precision medicine

We have personalized law, a new trend, though not so new perhaps. Legal rules tailored to individual, based on their needs, risk tolerance, metal capacities, etc. What are the ethical and legal implications of that? Does it make sense at all?

And then we have precision (personalized?) medicine.

# Nations and International Law

Interesting article about why nations do/should obey international law. Seems opuzzling. If law is binding by some state authority, then no state authority issues internatinal law. Might be a good addition or topic for the next version of my philosophy of law class.
