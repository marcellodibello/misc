## Theory of uncertainty? 

What is the right theory of uncertainty--the right inference engine that allows us to form beliefs and reach conclusions about events, facts and hypotheses that are uncertain? Now, clearly probability theory has to play a big role. Bayesianism is the theory. But that does not seem right. The main objection I see comes from **small worlds** or **unanticipated possibilities**. You calculate probabilities given a small world--say a game of chance, with fixed sample space and clearly defined rules governing the production of outcomes? Clearly probability applies there. And it is an excellent guide.

But you might have forgotten, not considered certain possibilities. Or these possibilities might not be salient to you at the time you construct your small world model relative to which you calculate the probabilities. So how can these probabilities be action guiding? They are model relative. They say: If the world is like the model, then the chances are like this. But what if the world is *not* like the model? Then, what? Then, the probabilities can be wrong and get you astray. 

This might not seem a bit problem. Everything, after all, is model relative. If the model is wrong, then the reccomendation coming from the model are wrong. The same applies to data. I base my decisions on data, but the data can be wrong or fabricated or whatever, and if so, then...I am in trouble! This is not a small problem, because the inferences and decisions we make are not make in small worl, but the real worl---the *big* world. So a theory of uncertainity should operate in the big world, not in the small world Bayesianim is a good theory of uncertainty in the small world, but what about the big world? So this is the question. 

This question becomes more pressing as we look at other realms or domain besides small worlds. What about law, finance, medicine or even personal life decisions? Even in science, say physics, it does not seem that probability---Bayesianism---gives us a good account of what is going on. 

In **law**, the most penetrating critique of Bayesianism is offered by Ron Allen. I know his work, but it would be good to get his objections all in one place.

In **economics**, monetary policy and social science, this book seems good as a critique of Bayesianism:

- John Kay and Mervyn King (2020), [Radical Uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Uncertainty-Decision-Making-Beyond-Numbers/dp/1324004770)

In philosopbhy of **science**, here is a survey article:

- John Norton, [Challenges to Bayesian confirmation theory](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Challenges_final.pdf)

How do **financial planners** make decisions? What guiding principles of uncertainty do they follow? Are they just guided by probabilities and expected utility?
