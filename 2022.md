## Algorithmic Fairness, Data, etc.

- [A Possibility in Algorithmic Fairness: Can Calibration and Equal Error Rates Be Reconciled?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07676.pdf)

I had intuitively reached this result alreay before this paper was published. I have a proff of this result based on Bayesian networks that seem easier to understand. But what is the significance of this?

- (RWL) [Metrics at Work: Journalism and the Contested Meaning of Algorithms](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691200002/metrics-at-work)

"Drawing on four years of fieldwork in web newsrooms in the United States and France, including more than one hundred interviews with journalists, Christin reveals many similarities among the media groups examined—their editorial goals, technological tools, and even office furniture. Yet she uncovers crucial and paradoxical differences in how American and French journalists understand audience analytics and how these affect the news produced in each country. American journalists routinely disregard traffic numbers and primarily rely on the opinion of their peers to define journalistic quality. Meanwhile, French journalists fixate on internet traffic and view these numbers as a sign of their resonance in the public sphere. Christin offers cultural and historical explanations for these disparities, arguing that distinct journalistic traditions structure how journalists make sense of digital measurements in the two countries."

- (RWL)[An Algorithmic Framework for Bias Bounties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10408)

"We propose and analyze an algorithmic framework for "bias bounties": events in which external participants are invited to propose improvements to a trained model, akin to bug bounty events in software and security. Our framework allows participants to submit arbitrary subgroup improvements, which are then algorithmically incorporated into an updated model. Our algorithm has the property that there is no tension between overall and subgroup accuracies, nor between different subgroup accuracies, and it enjoys provable convergence to either the Bayes optimal model or a state in which no further improvements can be found by the participants. We provide formal analyses of our framework, experimental evaluation, and findings from a preliminary bias bounty event."

This paper seems to fall into the argument -- which Robin and I agree -- that accuracy can be reconciled with, or take precedence over, fairness. 
To be read more carefully though.

## ASU exploitative research practises

- (RWL) [Genetic Research among the Havasupai: A Cautionary Tale](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/genetic-research-among-havasupai-cautionary-tale/2011-02)

"...researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) had gathered blood samples from them to search for a link to diabetes but used the samples to look for other diseases and genetic markers, thereby violating the basic tenets of human subject research. "

## Intruguing Math

- (RWL) [The notorious Collatz conjecture - Terence Tao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2p5eMWyaFs)

A seemingly simple math problem turns into something not even the most advanced math can solve!

## Common ground: Disagreement about Morality 

- [Self-organizing Moral Systems: Beyond Social Contract Theory](http://www.gaus.biz/Gaus-Self-organizing.pdf)

"Each person, we shall assume, is committed solely to her own integrity -- understood as her own judgments about first
level moral matters and the degree of reconciliation that her moral perspective endorses. I
shall assume that free, reasonable and competent moral agents will disagree about both of
these. Nevertheless, we shall see that under a surprising array of circumstances they can
secure a shared moral life endorsed by all. The social contract’s aim of full reconciliation can
be secured without any contract device. And, perhaps most surprisingly, moral agents can
arrive at this full reconciliation just because they disagree about the importance of
reconciliation."

- [Pitting People Against Each Other](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/papa.12158)

This and the other piece above could be interetsing to read for my upcomign seminar on the **common ground**.
