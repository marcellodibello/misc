## Complexity Theory, Evolution, social and legal system

Ronald Allen's idea that the legal system, especially the common law, is a complex adaptive system is interesting. For example, we see a lot of redundancies: the same right, entilement, legal remedy, etc. could be present via different laws and case law doctrines in the system. Therse redundancies, instead of being efficient and confusing, could be efficient as theyr improve the resiliency of the system, just like redundancy in the electric grid.

But the general question is what mechanism underlies the formation of this complex system. Is it something like evolution or is it something elese? I got interested in the relationship between evolution and complexity theory, whcih seems to be a complex one!

- [Natural selection and complex systems: a complex interaction](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/selforganisation-and-evolution-of-biological-and-social-systems/natural-selection-and-complex-systems-a-complex-interaction/638E5D875F94DA022C70E00049CA52EC)

"In their book Darwinism Evolving, Depew and Weber (1995) develop the thesis that evolutionary theory has been reformulated several times to keep pace with advances in knowledge about the physical world. Darwin's Newtonian formulation was replaced by a probabilistic formulation early in the twentieth century. According to Depew and Weber, the new science of complexity will force yet another formulation, which is taking place during our time."

Interesting, evolution relied (1) first on classical mechanic, (2) then probability and (3) now on complexity theory. So, perhaps, even an analysis of legal proof could be first, mechanistic, then probabilistic and finally complexity-based!

## Common Ground

I am started to think about my seminar on the common ground. There are several posisble angle to consider.

(1) Might be good to examine some **history** about the United States and perhpas England and look at perdiods when there was no common ground (e.g. deep religious divides) and how they coped with that division. For example:

- 1850 and debates about slavery in the United States
- England during the reformation 
- Tocqueville on democracy in America
- McCarthy era and freedom of speech
- Debates about teaching evolution in schools

Seems that often the solution, especially whne it comes to religious disagreements, is to force religion outside politcs. This is Rawls position, at least to some extent.

(2) Another approach is to look at some **core values** of the Uniedt States that are currentlu uder questions, such as:

- free speech
- meritocracy
- colorblindeness 
- individualism, free market
- what else?

It does seem that that the lack of a common ground politically is partially due to debates about these common values and ideals that are no longer appealing to everybody.

(3) Another thing to look at are changes in immigration policies, from **assimilation** too **integration** to something else. Looks like today the West is at a loss about the right immigration model. Western countries want not to impose  their own Western values on immigrants, but at the same time, this might create excessive fragmentation and thus a backlash against immigration.

(4) The roel of **facts and evidence** in rational inquiry. This is a  difficult topic, but here are some thoughts.

- Finding out the facts can be extremely complex, because of conflicting evidence and interpretations. See my little research about misinformation, where even whether masks are useful (which would seem to be obvious!) becomes controversial once you start looking at the evidence in academic journals. So facts, especially when it comes to social matters, are not easily verifiable -- not calculable, not algorithmically available. There is infinite complexity in the evidence. See also Ioannidis paper about why most scientists research is false. 

- To tame this complexity (see also Ronald Allen research) we might resort to a litigation system like in a trial where two or more parties are given the opportunity to present their arguments. This litigation model overcomes the problem of complexity in the evidence. The two parties will do their best. The problem is that this litigation model must have certain accepted rules of conduct -- honesty, cooperation, rational inquiry -- some kind of shared framework of inquiry. And this seems to be missing when it comes to political discussions. 

(5) We can also think about disagreement about facts (e.g. climate changes, masks and covid) versus disagreements about values (e.g. abortion). 
The point is however that any inquiry, even about facts, requires the committment to certain values. Science would be worthless if scientists were not committed to some level of honesty and integrity.

(6) In trial litigations, there is usually  common ground, stipulated facts, but also facts from science. How do they define science? Mostly, science is whatever scientists agree. So that is based on consensus, common ground, etc. 


## Epistemology and inquiry


- [Jane Friedman, The epistemic and the zetetic](https://jfriedmanphilo.github.io/E&Z.pdf)

Basic claim is that epistemic norms -- such as, if you have good strong evidence that p, you are allowed, or maybe even required, to come to know p or believe p -- conflict with zetetic norms (norms of inquiry) which sometimes may even prohibit you to consider evidence you have (or can easily have access to) and thus prohibit you to come to know whatvere you can or should know according to the epistemic norms. She gives the example of  gathering information about the number of windos in a building (say you are in the window business) and having to neglect other easily available evidence that could be the basis of knowledge for the sake of that inquiry.

I am not sure I see the pool of this kind of observation. It seems to me to be an easy problem. Or maybe not! Epistemic norms are norms about what it is epistemically rational to know, believe, be justified in believing given a certain stock of evidence. Zetetic norms are  dynamic. They are about acquiring evidence, when such acquisition is allowed, required, etc. I'd say that, if the formation of beliefs and knowledge takes place within an inquiry, then zetetic norms form the framework within with epistemic norms exist. So there is a priority ordering. But perhpas this complex relationship is precisely what Jane Friedman thought to be problematic.

I am interested in this sort of stuff. I have tried to write on it a numbere of times myself. One idea I have is this. There are bridge principles between the zetetic and the epistemic. For example: If an inquiry is open, then you should suspend judgment and if you suspend judgment you cannot know. You might have very good evidence for p and thus be in a position to know p (according to the epistemic norms) and yet the inquiry about p is still (rationally, according to the zetetic norm) open and thus you are NOT in a position to know p. So that is also another conflict betwen zetetic norms and epistemic norms. I find this more compelling that Friedman's example. But I think the conclusion is that epistemology should be invested into the zetetic (dynamic epistemology) rather than the epistemic (static epistemology). To be continued!


## Causal Models

Thoams Icard has created this interesting course about causal models, using also Bayes nets, for ESSLI. It is something I need to learn more in detail!

## Economists on the BARD Standard of Proof

- [Nuno Garoupa, Explaining the Standard of Proof in Criminal Law: A New Insight](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/692926)

Key idea is that the standard of proof BARD should be demanding because this would compesate for police officers' excessive appeatite (bias in favor of) arrast and punishment. So a stringent BARD is a good incentive against police officers arresting too many people. This argument does not rely on the traditiona appeal to the Blackstone ratio betwen false convictions and false acquittals.

"Because enforcers with punitive preferences might be overzealous, an effective way to mitigate such effect is to raise the standard of proof accordingly. In this context, we provide an argument for a beyond reasonable doubt standard even if the social costs of wrongful enforcement decisions are exactly the
same" (p. 113)

Indeed, a very strange thesis!

But the paper is interesting in that it points to quite a bit of empirical research in economics about why/whether mistaken convictions are bad for deterrence. It might be good to look at this economcic and emprical literature more closely. It strikes there is a lot of work by economists on procedural law, standards of proof etc. that philosophers do not look at, and that's bad!




## Evidential Epistemology

- [Keith Derose, Ought We to Follow Our Evidence?]

 Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 2000, Vol. 60, No. 3, pp. 697-706

Interetsing piece against [evidentialism](https://iep.utm.edu/evidenti/). One claim is that we outght to believe we are not BIV, but that we also don't have evidence for that. So, if we were to follow evidentilism and believe only proportionally to our evidence, we should not believe taht we are not BIV. Not I agree, but it's interetsing that De Rose one would be deranged not to be believe they are not a BIV. But the skeptical cases are interetsing examples of situation in which what your evidencd says (clearly no evidence against BIV hypthesis) might diverge from what you opiught to believe (despite your evidence).

"I think I  ought to believe this hypothesis (=BIV) is false, and to so believe very firmly and
 confidently indeed. One who really didn't firmly believe such an hypothesis to be false of himself would seem to me to be epistemically defective,
 perhaps even deranged, and is certainly not believing as he ought" (p. 703)
 
 "Now, in the matter of whether or not I'm a BIV, what attitude best fits  my evidence? My initial inclination is to say that I really don't have any
 effective evidence one way or the other. If this inclination is right, Feldman's evidentialist thesis would again be in trouble." (p. 704)

## Algorithmic Fairness, Data, etc.

- [A Possibility in Algorithmic Fairness: Can Calibration and Equal Error Rates Be Reconciled?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07676.pdf)

I had intuitively reached this result alreay before this paper was published. I have a proff of this result based on Bayesian networks that seem easier to understand. But what is the significance of this?

- (RWL) [Metrics at Work: Journalism and the Contested Meaning of Algorithms](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691200002/metrics-at-work)

"Drawing on four years of fieldwork in web newsrooms in the United States and France, including more than one hundred interviews with journalists, Christin reveals many similarities among the media groups examined—their editorial goals, technological tools, and even office furniture. Yet she uncovers crucial and paradoxical differences in how American and French journalists understand audience analytics and how these affect the news produced in each country. American journalists routinely disregard traffic numbers and primarily rely on the opinion of their peers to define journalistic quality. Meanwhile, French journalists fixate on internet traffic and view these numbers as a sign of their resonance in the public sphere. Christin offers cultural and historical explanations for these disparities, arguing that distinct journalistic traditions structure how journalists make sense of digital measurements in the two countries."

- [Michele E. Gilman](https://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/profiles/gilman/)

- (RWL)[An Algorithmic Framework for Bias Bounties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10408)

"We propose and analyze an algorithmic framework for "bias bounties": events in which external participants are invited to propose improvements to a trained model, akin to bug bounty events in software and security. Our framework allows participants to submit arbitrary subgroup improvements, which are then algorithmically incorporated into an updated model. Our algorithm has the property that there is no tension between overall and subgroup accuracies, nor between different subgroup accuracies, and it enjoys provable convergence to either the Bayes optimal model or a state in which no further improvements can be found by the participants. We provide formal analyses of our framework, experimental evaluation, and findings from a preliminary bias bounty event."

This paper seems to fall into the argument -- which Robin and I agree -- that accuracy can be reconciled with, or take precedence over, fairness. 
To be read more carefully though.

## Common ground: Disagreements about Morality 

- [Self-organizing Moral Systems: Beyond Social Contract Theory](http://www.gaus.biz/Gaus-Self-organizing.pdf)

"Each person, we shall assume, is committed solely to her own integrity -- understood as her own judgments about first
level moral matters and the degree of reconciliation that her moral perspective endorses. I
shall assume that free, reasonable and competent moral agents will disagree about both of
these. Nevertheless, we shall see that under a surprising array of circumstances they can
secure a shared moral life endorsed by all. The social contract’s aim of full reconciliation can
be secured without any contract device. And, perhaps most surprisingly, moral agents can
arrive at this full reconciliation just because they disagree about the importance of
reconciliation."

- [Pitting People Against Each Other](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/papa.12158)

This and the other piece above could be interetsing to read for my upcomign seminar on the **common ground**. 

## Truth incentives and science

 - (RWL) [On Fraud](http://www.liamkofibright.com/uploads/4/8/9/8/48985425/on_fraud_online_first.pdf)

"...calls for scientists to more consciously adopt the veritistic ideal in their own work.
In this paper I argue against such promotion of the veritistic ideal. It turns out that a
sincere desire on the part of scientists to see the truth propagated may well promote
more fraud rather than less."

So seeking the truth leads to more fraud! Interesting! 

Might be useful to see if the kind of model used here can be applied to trial decisiojn-making. Does an explicitly vertistic ideal applied to legal decision salso lead to more deception and lower accuracy rates? It would be surpsring if it did, but it does in science, why makes the system of incentives in legal decision differrent from that of the science?
