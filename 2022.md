## Truth and Meaning

- [Truth and Meaning – In Perspective](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/678/docs/Selected_Publication/Truth_and_Meaning.pdf)

Interesting and clear discussion bu Scott Soames of some the problmes of the Davidsonian project of a theory of meaning 
(from back in the 60ies). 

-Davidson, [Truth and Meaning](https://www.uh.edu/~garson/Truth%20and%20Meaning.pdf)

Citing an objection  by John Foster, Soames considers the following T-theorem:

‘Mis pantelones son verdes’ is true in LS iff my pants are green and first-order
arithmetic is incomplete.

Now, it seems, this T-theorem does not give us the meaning of "mis pantalones son verdes". It is nontranslational because of the 
added bit about the incompleteness of arithmetic. Perhaps we can limit T-theorems in a theory of meaning to translational theorems, just like:

‘Mis pantelones son verdes’ is true in LS iff my pants are green.

But here Soames notes (p. 8) that:

"Knowing what is stated by the translational truth theory T1 is no more helpful in coming to understand LS than
knowing what is stated by the nontranslational T2 -- unless one also knows, of that which is stated by T1, that it is expressed by a translational theory. If one wrongly thinks that T1 is nontranslational, then knowledge of the truth conditions it states won’t yield knowledge of
meaning. Thus, knowledge of what is stated by even the best truth theories is insufficient for understanding meaning."

In other words, I need to know that the T-theorem is translational -- i.e. that it gives me the meaning of the sentence in question -- in order for the T-theorem to give me the meaning of the sentence, but if so, the T-theorem would not play an explanatory role in a theory of meaning.

Soames considers a recent attempt to defend Davidson's paradigm (p. 13):

"Higginbotham would say: if you know not only (i) that ‘mis pantelones son verdes’ is true in
Spanish iff my pants are green, but also (ii) that necessarily, one who understands that sentence
knows (i), and so on for further iterations, then you know that the sentence means that my pants
are green, and not that my pants are green and arithmetic is incomplete. Repeating this for
every sentence should, he suggests, be sufficient for understanding the language."

So, knowing the T-theorem alone isn't enough to grasp the meaning. One must also know that, necessarily, 
for one to *understand* the sentence, one must know the T-theorem (=‘mis pantelones son verdes’ is true in
Spanish iff my pants are green). Soames has a convoluted objection here, but he also makes a 
pretty interetsing point (almost on the side, p.  16-17):

"Instead, the theories that genuinely explain meaning contain Davidsonian theories as parts, while making further claims
about knowledge and understanding. Since questions about what counts as understanding
sentences and other expressions are closely tied to questions about their meanings -- over and
above their truth and reference conditions – the exciting initial thought that Davidsonian
theories would explicate meaning in wholly extensional terms has gone by the boards. This
need not be an objection. But it is a fact."

Higginbotham's approach, in the end, rests on *understanding*, not just T-theorems, to give a theory of meaning. 
So, meaning is explicated with understanding. Not an objection, but certainly something that makes the 
Davidsonian project less dramatic.

Scoames objection consists of this rtwo T-theorems:

(2) ‘2 = 2 and if n = 2, there are numbers x,y,z such that xn + yn = zn, 
but if n > 2, there are no such numbers’ is true in L iff **2 = 2** and if n = 2, there are numbers x,y,z such that xn + yn  = zn, 
but if n > 2, there are no such numbers. 

(3) ‘2 = 2 and if n = 2, there are numbers x,y,z such that xn + yn = zn, but if n > 2, there are
no such numbers’ is true in L iff if n = 2, there are numbers x,y,z such that xn + yn = zn,
but if n > 2, there are no such numbers.

The difference is the use of "2=2" in one T-theorem but not in the other.

## Java and computer science


- (RWL) [Book: Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Interdisciplinary-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/0134076427)

Nice intro do computer science and java programming. The book also comes with a [website](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/). 
There are also [recorded lectures](https://cuvids.io/app/video/3/watch) that seem pretty good.

- Consider this piece of (silly!) java code:

>
>      public class Main {
>      public static void main(String[] args) {
>      int b = 2;
>	     
>	     bla();
>	     System.out.print(b);
>	  }
>	   
>	   public static void bla() {
>	       int b = 3;
>	       System.out.print(b);
>	      
>	    }
>	   }

Now the output of this code is simply:

>  32

Why? Well, you first call bla() which prints the value of b (assigned to 3) and then you print the value of b (assigned to 2).
Even though b is the same variable name, it is initialized twice (outside the method bla and also inside the method bla). So it takes two diferent values (3 and 2) and that is why we get 32 and not 33 as output.

But let's change the code:

>     public class Main {
>	    public static void main(String[] args) {
>	    int b = 2;
>	   
>	     
>	     bla(b);
>	     System.out.print(b);
>	  }
>	   
>	   public static void bla(int b) {
>	      
>	      System.out.print(b);
>	      
>	    }
>   	}


Now the output is 22, because variable b is assigned to the same value both in the method bla and outside the method bla.


What abot this?

>     public class Main {
>	    public static void main(String[] args) {
>	    int b = 2;
>	   
>	     
>	     bla(b);
>	     System.out.print(b);
>	  }
>	   
>	   public static void bla(int b) {
>	      b = 4;
>	      System.out.print(b);
>	      
>	    }
>   	}

Interestingly, the output now is:

>  42

This is becaue b is assigned to 4 inside the method bla, but that assignment is forgotten after the method is closed, and thus b is still assigned 
to 2 outside the method bla. Thus, we get 42. 

But there is a further variation. Consider this:


>     public class Main {
>     
>     public static int b = 7;
>     
>     public static void bla() {
>     b = 4;
>     }
>	    
>	    public static void main(String[] args) {
>	   
>	    b = 2;
>	    bla();
>	    System.out.print(b);
>	   	      
>	    }
>   	}


Here the output is 4 (not 2!), because the method bla essentially assigns 4 to b after 2 has been assigned to b, and thus the program prints 4. And that assignments to b is not forgotten. The key is initialization earlier "public static int b = 7".


But here is a further wrinkle:

>     public class Main {
>     
>     public static int b = 7;
>     
>     public static void bla() {
>     b = 4;
>     }
>	    
>	    public static void main(String[] args) {
>	   
>	    int b = 2;   // This is what changed! //
>	    bla();
>	    System.out.print(b);
>	   	      
>	    }
>   	}

This program will print 2 (not 4!). Note that b has been initialized to 2 and this holds for the main method, whereas before 2 had beeen assifned to b, but there was not initialization. 

- It's interetsing to trace the execution of a java program using this [tool](https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/java_visualize/).

## Common ground

In discussing this with J and F, I am becomign convinced that 
the common ground operates at differebnt level -- i.e. it is consituted 
by different things at each level and
plays a different at each level.

**Level 1**: The common ground as condition for meaningful communication. 
Here the common ground comprises linguistic competency as well as 
some shared beliefes about the world. Readings from Quine, Davidson and Stalnaker. 

**Level 2**: The common ground as condition for cooperative rational inquiry. 
Here the common ground comprises shared rules of inquiry and rational dialogue. 
See Aquinas phrase "contra impugnantes principia non est disputandum."
Aristotle also talked about endoxa. Readings from 
argumentation theory and Amsterdam school of argumentation. 

**Level 3**: The common ground as condition for discussions about matters 
of facts. Here the comon ground comprises shared rules and norms about evidence 
and facts. See Ionannids paper "why most scientific research is false".

**Level 4**: The common ground as condition for political decision-making. Following Rawls, the common 
ground here comprises "overlapping consensus", a shared set of values and reasons taht reasonable 
people would reasonably agree to use in crafting polical arguments. See also Cohen on this.

**Level 5**: The common ground as condition for belonging 
and national identity. Readings in postcolonial theory. 



## Algorithmic Fairness

[Group Fairness Is Not Derivable From Justice: a Mathematical Proof](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03880.pdf)

Key argument here:

"We define a procedure to be group-fair, and for the sake of brevity, "fair", in what
follows, when individuals who deserve the same treatment are not more likely to receive
a favorable treatment because of the group to which they belong." (sec. 4.3)

"The argument can be summarized as follows. Suppose we are dealing with a deterministic procedure, 
where we can always conceive the set of determinant facts, X, causing the acquittal of the defendant. 
These facts will either obtain, or not. If, when
the facts obtain, the defendant is innocent, the procedure is perfect. Otherwise, the
determinant facts will not obtain for all innocent individual, or they will also obtain
for some guilty ones. In this case, the procedure is imperfect, and the two groups
X = 0 and X = 1 are morally arbitrary. Innocent individuals have different chances
of benefiting from the procedure, depending on their two groups X = 0 or X = 1.
Therefore, group fairness is not satisfied." (sec. 5)

The problem, however, with this argument seems to be that groups X=0 and X=1 are identfiable only after 
the trial has taken place. The facts that causa acquittals and convictions do not seem facts the exist prior to the trial itself.
So, saying that "Innocent individuals have different chances of benefiting from the procedure" seems strange.

## Complexity Theory, Evolution, social and legal system

Ronald Allen's idea that the legal system, especially the common law, is a complex adaptive system is interesting. For example, we see a lot of redundancies: the same right, entilement, legal remedy, etc. could be present via different laws and case law doctrines in the system. Therse redundancies, instead of being efficient and confusing, could be efficient as theyr improve the resiliency of the system, just like redundancy in the electric grid.

But the general question is what mechanism underlies the formation of this complex system. Is it something like evolution or is it something elese? I got interested in the relationship between evolution and complexity theory, whcih seems to be a complex one!

- [Natural selection and complex systems: a complex interaction](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/selforganisation-and-evolution-of-biological-and-social-systems/natural-selection-and-complex-systems-a-complex-interaction/638E5D875F94DA022C70E00049CA52EC)

"In their book Darwinism Evolving, Depew and Weber (1995) develop the thesis that evolutionary theory has been reformulated several times to keep pace with advances in knowledge about the physical world. Darwin's Newtonian formulation was replaced by a probabilistic formulation early in the twentieth century. According to Depew and Weber, the new science of complexity will force yet another formulation, which is taking place during our time."

Interesting, evolution relied (1) first on classical mechanic, (2) then probability and (3) now on complexity theory. So, perhaps, even an analysis of legal proof could be first, mechanistic, then probabilistic and finally complexity-based!

## Common Ground

I am started to think about my seminar on the common ground. There are several posisble angle to consider.

(1) Might be good to examine some **history** about the United States and perhpas England and look at perdiods when there was no common ground (e.g. deep religious divides) and how they coped with that division. For example:

- 1850 and debates about slavery in the United States
- England during the reformation 
- Tocqueville on democracy in America
- McCarthy era and freedom of speech
- Debates about teaching evolution in schools

Seems that often the solution, especially whne it comes to religious disagreements, is to force religion outside politcs. This is Rawls position, at least to some extent.

(2) Another approach is to look at some **core values** of the Uniedt States that are currentlu uder questions, such as:

- free speech
- meritocracy
- colorblindeness 
- individualism, free market
- what else?

It does seem that that the lack of a common ground politically is partially due to debates about these common values and ideals that are no longer appealing to everybody.

(3) Another thing to look at are changes in immigration policies, from **assimilation** too **integration** to something else. Looks like today the West is at a loss about the right immigration model. Western countries want not to impose  their own Western values on immigrants, but at the same time, this might create excessive fragmentation and thus a backlash against immigration.

(4) The roel of **facts and evidence** in rational inquiry. This is a  difficult topic, but here are some thoughts.

- Finding out the facts can be extremely complex, because of conflicting evidence and interpretations. See my little research about misinformation, where even whether masks are useful (which would seem to be obvious!) becomes controversial once you start looking at the evidence in academic journals. So facts, especially when it comes to social matters, are not easily verifiable -- not calculable, not algorithmically available. There is infinite complexity in the evidence. See also Ioannidis paper about why most scientists research is false. 

- To tame this complexity (see also Ronald Allen research) we might resort to a litigation system like in a trial where two or more parties are given the opportunity to present their arguments. This litigation model overcomes the problem of complexity in the evidence. The two parties will do their best. The problem is that this litigation model must have certain accepted rules of conduct -- honesty, cooperation, rational inquiry -- some kind of shared framework of inquiry. And this seems to be missing when it comes to political discussions. 

(5) We can also think about disagreement about facts (e.g. climate changes, masks and covid) versus disagreements about values (e.g. abortion). 
The point is however that any inquiry, even about facts, requires the committment to certain values. Science would be worthless if scientists were not committed to some level of honesty and integrity.

(6) In trial litigations, there is usually  common ground, stipulated facts, but also facts from science. How do they define science? Mostly, science is whatever scientists agree. So that is based on consensus, common ground, etc. 


## Epistemology and inquiry


- [Jane Friedman, The epistemic and the zetetic](https://jfriedmanphilo.github.io/E&Z.pdf)

Basic claim is that epistemic norms -- such as, if you have good strong evidence that p, you are allowed, or maybe even required, to come to know p or believe p -- conflict with zetetic norms (norms of inquiry) which sometimes may even prohibit you to consider evidence you have (or can easily have access to) and thus prohibit you to come to know whatvere you can or should know according to the epistemic norms. She gives the example of  gathering information about the number of windos in a building (say you are in the window business) and having to neglect other easily available evidence that could be the basis of knowledge for the sake of that inquiry.

I am not sure I see the pool of this kind of observation. It seems to me to be an easy problem. Or maybe not! Epistemic norms are norms about what it is epistemically rational to know, believe, be justified in believing given a certain stock of evidence. Zetetic norms are  dynamic. They are about acquiring evidence, when such acquisition is allowed, required, etc. I'd say that, if the formation of beliefs and knowledge takes place within an inquiry, then zetetic norms form the framework within with epistemic norms exist. So there is a priority ordering. But perhpas this complex relationship is precisely what Jane Friedman thought to be problematic.

I am interested in this sort of stuff. I have tried to write on it a numbere of times myself. One idea I have is this. There are bridge principles between the zetetic and the epistemic. For example: If an inquiry is open, then you should suspend judgment and if you suspend judgment you cannot know. You might have very good evidence for p and thus be in a position to know p (according to the epistemic norms) and yet the inquiry about p is still (rationally, according to the zetetic norm) open and thus you are NOT in a position to know p. So that is also another conflict betwen zetetic norms and epistemic norms. I find this more compelling that Friedman's example. But I think the conclusion is that epistemology should be invested into the zetetic (dynamic epistemology) rather than the epistemic (static epistemology). To be continued!

## Economists on the BARD Standard of Proof

- [Nuno Garoupa, Explaining the Standard of Proof in Criminal Law: A New Insight](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/692926)

Key idea is that the standard of proof BARD should be demanding because this would compesate for police officers' excessive appeatite (bias in favor of) arrast and punishment. So a stringent BARD is a good incentive against police officers arresting too many people. This argument does not rely on the traditiona appeal to the Blackstone ratio betwen false convictions and false acquittals.

"Because enforcers with punitive preferences might be overzealous, an effective way to mitigate such effect is to raise the standard of proof accordingly. In this context, we provide an argument for a beyond reasonable doubt standard even if the social costs of wrongful enforcement decisions are exactly the
same" (p. 113)

Indeed, a very strange thesis!

But the paper is interesting in that it points to quite a bit of empirical research in economics about why/whether mistaken convictions are bad for deterrence. It might be good to look at this economcic and emprical literature more closely. It strikes there is a lot of work by economists on procedural law, standards of proof etc. that philosophers do not look at, and that's bad!




## Evidential Epistemology

- [Keith Derose, Ought We to Follow Our Evidence?]

 Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 2000, Vol. 60, No. 3, pp. 697-706

Interetsing piece against [evidentialism](https://iep.utm.edu/evidenti/). One claim is that we outght to believe we are not BIV, but that we also don't have evidence for that. So, if we were to follow evidentilism and believe only proportionally to our evidence, we should not believe taht we are not BIV. Not I agree, but it's interetsing that De Rose one would be deranged not to be believe they are not a BIV. But the skeptical cases are interetsing examples of situation in which what your evidencd says (clearly no evidence against BIV hypthesis) might diverge from what you opiught to believe (despite your evidence).

"I think I  ought to believe this hypothesis (=BIV) is false, and to so believe very firmly and
 confidently indeed. One who really didn't firmly believe such an hypothesis to be false of himself would seem to me to be epistemically defective,
 perhaps even deranged, and is certainly not believing as he ought" (p. 703)
 
 "Now, in the matter of whether or not I'm a BIV, what attitude best fits  my evidence? My initial inclination is to say that I really don't have any
 effective evidence one way or the other. If this inclination is right, Feldman's evidentialist thesis would again be in trouble." (p. 704)

"Drawing on four years of fieldwork in web newsrooms in the United States and France, including more than one hundred interviews with journalists, Christin reveals many similarities among the media groups examined—their editorial goals, technological tools, and even office furniture. Yet she uncovers crucial and paradoxical differences in how American and French journalists understand audience analytics and how these affect the news produced in each country. American journalists routinely disregard traffic numbers and primarily rely on the opinion of their peers to define journalistic quality. Meanwhile, French journalists fixate on internet traffic and view these numbers as a sign of their resonance in the public sphere. Christin offers cultural and historical explanations for these disparities, arguing that distinct journalistic traditions structure how journalists make sense of digital measurements in the two countries."

- [Michele E. Gilman](https://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/profiles/gilman/)

- (RWL)[An Algorithmic Framework for Bias Bounties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10408)

"We propose and analyze an algorithmic framework for "bias bounties": events in which external participants are invited to propose improvements to a trained model, akin to bug bounty events in software and security. Our framework allows participants to submit arbitrary subgroup improvements, which are then algorithmically incorporated into an updated model. Our algorithm has the property that there is no tension between overall and subgroup accuracies, nor between different subgroup accuracies, and it enjoys provable convergence to either the Bayes optimal model or a state in which no further improvements can be found by the participants. We provide formal analyses of our framework, experimental evaluation, and findings from a preliminary bias bounty event."

This paper seems to fall into the argument -- which Robin and I agree -- that accuracy can be reconciled with, or take precedence over, fairness. 
To be read more carefully though.

"Each person, we shall assume, is committed solely to her own integrity -- understood as her own judgments about first
level moral matters and the degree of reconciliation that her moral perspective endorses. I
shall assume that free, reasonable and competent moral agents will disagree about both of
these. Nevertheless, we shall see that under a surprising array of circumstances they can
secure a shared moral life endorsed by all. The social contract’s aim of full reconciliation can
be secured without any contract device. And, perhaps most surprisingly, moral agents can
arrive at this full reconciliation just because they disagree about the importance of
reconciliation."

## Truth incentives and science

 - (RWL) [On Fraud](http://www.liamkofibright.com/uploads/4/8/9/8/48985425/on_fraud_online_first.pdf)

"...calls for scientists to more consciously adopt the veritistic ideal in their own work.
In this paper I argue against such promotion of the veritistic ideal. It turns out that a
sincere desire on the part of scientists to see the truth propagated may well promote
more fraud rather than less."

So seeking the truth leads to more fraud! Interesting! 

Might be useful to see if the kind of model used here can be applied to trial decisiojn-making. Does an explicitly vertistic ideal applied to legal decision salso lead to more deception and lower accuracy rates? It would be surpsring if it did, but it does in science, why makes the system of incentives in legal decision differrent from that of the science?
